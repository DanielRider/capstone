Hello all,1
Im just coming here to rant as I am so fed up with all of the inconvenience that MS brings,1
I was diagnosed last April,1
put on kesimpta in July,1
I had the option between kesimpta,1
ocrevus and tecfidera,1
I thought kesimpta would be the easiest to maintain as Im not good at taking meds everyday consistently  I dont drive so Ocrevus seemed like sort of a hassle to get to infusion well now Im sitting here wishing I didnt have to deal with any of this,1
When I was first diagnosed I considered myself lucky to get caredx so quick and to finally know whats wrong with me but now I just feel as if its all a burden,1
At the end of January I went on to Optum my specialty pharm and my kesimpta was not eligible to be refilled,1
I tried to refill my other meds and they couldnt reach my drs office to refill,1
I know all of this could probably be figured out so quick and,1
but maybe its an insurance issue because its always been refilled,2
I guess I wont know until I try but thats the thing,1
I dont even have the energy to try,1
I havent taken my kesimpta since dec th,1
I havent seencorresponded with my neuro since last June,1
I just feel as if Im a burden to them and I feel as if my MS is a burden to myself,1
I have made multiple appts since November but then my family got covid,1
and then I got covid and then there was an outbreak at the facility I work at so I wanted to stay away from my drs office until all of that ended so now my appt is on feb  so I figure Ill just try to get it worked out then,1

POTS Did anybody else read this,2
They are still doing research on this,0
but I found what they know so far to be really interesting   A novel therapy,0
tested ex vivo,0
has been successful at correcting the dysfunctional body mechanism in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome POTS,0
Researchers have discovered how genes that protect against Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome POTS become silent or switched off and have identified a drug to switch them on again,0
POTS is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance as their primary symptom,0
in which a reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after the person stands up from a lying-down position,0
A main symptom in a third of POTS patients is fainting,0
The researchers were from Monash University and led by Professor Sam El-Osta who said that while the gene implicated in POTS  norepinephrine transporter NET  had been known for several decades,0
past research had failed to find a genetic mutation responsible for the symptoms,0
This latest study revealed that the enzyme EZH is responsible for silencing this,0

I recently had the rare instance of being constipated,1
unable to have a BM,1
for almost  days this hasnt happened in a long while,1
and then my Citrucel finally kicked in and I had very healthy stools,1
In fact,1
I had  BMs today,1
with the second having urgency and extremely painful gas in my lower left side,1
But it only made me feel WORSE,1
if that makes any sense at all,1
Sometimes when I finally have a big BM or ,1
my intestines feel gurgly,1
and sensitive for the rest of the day,1
Its as if my body doesnt want me to have BMs closer to whats considered normal,1

I have been IBS-C since I was a kid was diagnosed as a young adult,1

so I just assumed it was psychosomatic especially since it seems like I forget how to andor coordinate a swallow,1
Skip to last week a heavy period of anxiety and stress preceding and I start getting a tickle in my throat and issues with my own saliva,1
For the last - days it has been a feeling of something in the back of my throat like the airway almost like saliva tickling,1
I dont have a cough reflex triggered,1
but I cant help but clear my throat or force myself to cough to try and bring something up,1
Ive even noticed or perceived my voice to be gurgly or wet,1
but everyone I know has denied it,1
Last night specifically I felt like I was drowning and had a panic attack,1
Like no matter how much I swallowed there was what felt like an insane amount of saliva in the back of my throat,1
Now I feel like Im throat clearing after drinking fluids,1
eating  just pretty constant throughout the day,1
I have also noticed that if I go to take a deep breath,1
I feel like I cant do it fully,1

sleep Hi all,1
I started a new job recently which i enjoy a lot but its taken a toll on my energy levels and after my first week of working,1
i was so exhausted by Wednesday but kept pushing through,1
Thursday night,1
i had the weirdest sensation which started in my legs snd crawled up to my shoulders,1
It was a tingling sensation at first then a vibration which i couldnt ignore and it kept me up for - hours since lying,1
I read that this is common in people who have MS but I couldnt find any way to treat this particular thing,3
I had the same vibrations Friday night but only took me an hour to fall asleep that time,3
I took mg of Valerian Root on Friday night so that mightve helped,3
Does anyone else ever experience this and what do you do to fall asleep faster and more,2
My IBS started exactly around one year ago after being prescribed a cocktail of antibiotics for a,1
Following that medication my gut health had been the worst it had EVER been,3
I had every GI symptom imaginable,3
My initial symptoms were malabsorption and diarrhea for around  months,3
After around  months,1
I started to bloat a lot and I had horrible gas and burping for another few months coupled with extreme pain in my colon,1
Then following this I would wake up with intense nausea and intestinal burning every single day,1
I also had extreme histamine reactions to all sorts of foods,1
My skin was also covered in acne,1
I was later diagnosed with gastritis had ulcers everywhere but was h pylori negative,1
I also had a host of other symptoms that I feel dissociated from now,1
I started off with a simple drug store probiotic thinking thats all I need to heal,3
It did nothing,3
I then tried l glutamine,3
slippery elm,3
marshmallow root,3
Although these things did soothe my gut I still had a plethora of symptoms like bloody stools,3
extreme bloating and gut pains and also early satiety,3
I felt like pulling my hair out because conventional gut healing protocols just werent working,3
I would cry every single day because I felt like this is my reality now,3
I then stumbled upon the Rs technique and I started with eliminating all fodmaps,3
processed food for  weeks and a course of herbals to clean the system out,3
I proceeded with using gut soothers such as cabbage juice,3
glutamine powder,3
slippery elm,3
marshmallow root tea,3
I would also drink turmeric in tea,3
camomile and peppermint teas,3
hot water with fenugreek seeds and fennel seeds,3
hot water with lemon and apple cider vinegar shot,3
I also kept my diet super super clean with lots of steamed fish and non starchy veg,3
I then started adding in probiotics,3
digestive enzymes,3
betaine hcl,3
digestive bitters,3
apple cider vinegar before all meals,3
hot water and lemon and ginger teas sipped  throughout the day,3
Finally I started adding in fodmaps again,3
more probiotics and fermented fooods  lots of fibre especially in the form of berry smoothies with lots of greens and seeds,3
Despite doing all of this,3
my gut health was still awful and I kept spiralling down into a deep depression thinking this is my reality,3
If you havent checked out Elliot Overton on YouTube then I suggest that you do,3
Just  weeks of megadosing thiamine hcl and a few days of thiamax and Im almost recovered,3

I lived with my mom at the time,3
so I went to say goodnight to her and then I saw her face morphing before my eyes,3
Her face was morphing to look like different peoples facesperhaps a new face every  seconds,3
I screamed at her STOP DOING THAT WITH YOUR FACE,3
I thought it was entirely real at the time,3
She said doing what and I burst into tears,3
telling her she knows what shes doing,3
I ran to my room and lay down,3
trying to console myself and get my head around wtf was going on,3
I got this weird belief that the devil was in my room,3
I couldnt turn the light off or put my phone down,3

facts  Last spring I experienced an altered state of consciousness which involved  Feeling intense ecstatic joy Experiencing full body waves of electricity,1
Losing my sense of self entirely  Feeling connected to the universe Experiencing strange connections between things that seem unrelated Believing I could make the flowers grow with my mind Hearing messages in the radio from God Experiencing everything as if it were shapes and motions rather than things,1
the roundabout as I was driving up to it looked like a washing machine and cars were sloshing about in it rather than just being cars hard to explain Experiencing time slowing down,1
as if I could watch everything happen in slow,1
presently  I began taking ADHD meds Methylphenidate about  months ago from a low dose to mg XR,3
I have been having the following experiences as well  Rising sensations in the stomach accompanied almost always by a visceral sensation of fear,3
Choking feeling in the throat,3
Tension headaches,3
 Vertigo,3
Sensation of extreme heat in the body,3
radiating out,3
Muscle tension particularly in shoulders,3
neck and middle back and usually following on from the above feelings,3
Body tingling all over and at different rates,3
This happens most often either at night during interrupted sleep or during meditation,3
I used to meditate a lot but have recently found that I cannot do this without experiencing these unpleasant results,3
I am at a loss,1
I feel like a hypochondriac,1
but I cant work out what is happening to me,1
I saw my doctor for the headaches and shes done a basic neurological exam twice and is happy that I dont have any tumours or problems elsewise,1
but Im going mad not knowing what is happening,1
I feel like I have no choice but to wait for something worse to happen,1
Im scared,1
I dont want this to get worse,1
but I feel like Im not being taken seriously,1
I once opened up to this community before and I was treated with some disdain by commenters who thought that because I was not diagnosed officially that I was trying to make light of their condition,1
nothing could be further from the truth,1
I just want to stop something from happening before it does,1
I dont want to have a fit in public or in front of my family,1
I dont want to hurt my brain anymore if it is getting damaged by some kind of focal seizure,1
I dont have anyone to talk to,1
My housemate would laugh in my face and my doctors dont take me seriously,1
My family embrace all of the mystical experiences that I have,1
but they dont want to pathologise it,1
but a bit naive considering that it could get worse and that they will probably absolve themselves of responsibility when it comes to that,1

 years old,1
About six months ago,1
I started getting incidents of numbness in my left leg,1
around my knee and in the front of my thigh,1
It would happen after I had been inactive and then became active,1
like getting up from my desk after a while and then walking around the shop,1
and only last a few minutes,1
I didnt think much of it,1
thought maybe I was sitting weird or something,1
and it mostly went away a couple months,1
Six weeks ago,1
I rapidly lost most of the vision in my right eye,1
I could still see shadows,1

Five weeks later and my eye is back to about ,1
It gets worse in certain situations but it does feel like it is continuing to slowly improve,1
I understand it may never go back to normal but it is a lot better than it was a little over a month,1
In the past week the numbness in my left leg has reappeared somewhat,1
It is much less severe than it was before,1
but it is more constant,1
For whatever reason this has had an even more profound effect on me emotionally than my eye did,1
Perhaps because I am realizing this is probably not a coincidence and MS is very likely in the cards,1
My dad is a carrier,1
and CF runs in my dads side of the family,1

Anyone else have,2
And is there anything that helped,2
upI started not just eating non acidic foods but actually targeting alkaline rich,1
Then I started taking,1
work My husband had a seizure for the first time at work,1
Is his work at all liable to help cover bills since it happened,2
specks The only weirdness Ive ever seen with my poop is blood after food poisoning  years or so ago,1
But today it came out in big round pieces with black specks in it,1
Wiping was normal,1
I leak mucus in general,1
and after trying oil of oregano for sibo and having a horrible reaction to it,1
Im certainly anxious I might never poop normally again,1
This was last year,1
and since then,1
I went from one constipated poop a day to randomly  or more times,1
sometimes with urgency,1
Leaking gets worse when I need the,1
recovery Ive stopped taking risperidone and still dont have any,1
How long will this,2
I was on PPIs for about  years since I was about ,1
I was always extremely healthy but my stomach and throat constantly felt like a volcano,1
Id have sore throats,1
a hoarse voice,1
bad breath,1
I tried a few times to get off but couldnt,1
Id get awful flare ups and would jump back,1
I went vegan about  months ago for a month or two and tried not to eat processed food at all while weaning off PPIs,1
Honestly I still got bad acid reflux but to counter it this sounds a bit ridiculous I chewed a ton of gum which stimulates saliva and helps digestion which helped to relieve acidity flare,3
I started eating lots of eggs and some dairy and fish occasionally in small portions but have noticed I basically never have acid reflux,3
Ive tried a lot of times and gave up because it was just too uncomfortable to keep going without PPIs,3
I gave myself time to push past it,3
ate healthy,3
exercised and now I feel like Im pretty much ,3
Long story short is that Ive been experiencing symptoms since Aug,1
 that have gotten more pronounced after a two week attack in late Novearly Dec that brought on more reoccurring,1
I saw a neurologist Dec,0
 who was convinced it was a b deficiency but that came back,0
In the meantime Im struggling,1

Diagnosed with GERD and,1
Smoked everyday for the last  years,1
no want to,1
When I was about  I started hearing and seeing these black yet transparent tombstone shaped things with green glowing eyes,1
one of them had red eyes,1
They told me to do things like pick up an objects  times and then turn it,1
flip it sideways things like that,1
Also to turn to my right or left,1
on my stomach and back when trying to sleep,1
Tap my hand on my arm so many times yadayada,1
I dont have OCD,1
just some symptoms of it but not serious enough to qualify for diagnosis,1
But these voices would tell me if I didnt do what they told me to my cat would die,1
family members would die,1
things like that,1
Around  I stopped seeing and hearing them,1
but I began hearing miscellaneous noises,1
in particular I remember it sounding like there was a dinner party,1
dishes clinking,1
indecipherable speech,1
spontaneous laughing I also frequently heard a flute being played,1
Then there was a break from all that,1
I didnt start hallucinating again until high school,1
I was around  when I saw a racoon that wasnt real,1
I saw it through a car window and was excited and adored it,1
but as the car moved and the metal between the front and back door passed through,1
the raccoon suddenly disappeared,1
I saw a head with no face peeking out from a doorway,1
And I saw somebody walking down the sidewalk,1
but as they went behind a street sign,1
they didnt appear on the other side,1
Present day I dont think Ive hallucinated really,1
There have been a few things that maybe were hallucinations,1
Sounds I couldnt find the source of,1
things like that,1
But overall it seems done,1
Has anyone else experienced,2
EEG Im ,1
I had my first seizure at ,1
and it was a status elipticus,1
I came to with EMTs pinning me down in the process of attempting to intubation me,1
it was not pretty,1
My wife and I had just moved to Colorado from Florida,1
so we and the doctors at the time chalked it up to new environment,1
Everyone gets one,1
I was told,1
My next tonic clinic would come about  months later pictured,1
What I did not realize at the time,1
was that I would go on to continue having simplepartial complex and absence seizures in between that continued to wreck my,1
I was a chemistry teacher about halfway through graduate school I realized I enjoyed teaching more than doing chemistry research,1
and was having absence seizures during classes,1
department meetings,1
Being new to the school and not having co-workers who knew me,1
they probably thought I was the worst teacher on the planet,1
One example is when I was sitting at my desk about to dismiss a class when,1
from my perspective,1
it disappeared and an entirely new set of students appeared in their place,1
I had an absence seizure while classes were changing,1
and I missed all of it,1
sitting next to the door,1
If there ever was a real-life glitch-in-the-matrix moment,1
this was it,1
I could see it in their eyes when I came,1
Another instance was during a department meeting in which I had apparently given a presentation to our department on new instruction techniques,1
A couple weeks later my Department head come up to me in the hallway in between classes,1
confused as to why I had not implemented these techniques in my own room,1
In that moment,1
I had zero clue what they were on about,1
Zero memory of that meeting I gave a presentation,1

and have gone to the bathroom over  times,3

Last night I took mg of mdma with  friends at their place,1
dropped at pm,1
I went to go to bed at around qm so definitely felt sober,1
It was my nd night of no sleep,1
but when I turned my lights off and noticed little black dots starting  dart around my ceiling,1
Eventually over about  minutes those grew into huge spiders,1
Probably  of them crawling around my ceiling,1
I freaked and turned the lights on,1
They disappeared,1
Turned them back off,1
and there were so many more creatures all crawling around,1
some terried me second time seeing it all there,1
but most I could just convince myself Im sleep deprived and hallucinating,1
They went away as sun,1
Couldnt sleep at all that morning,1
and when I closed my  eyes I kept seeing these people that would talk to me about some pretty concerning shit,1
Iv had md dreams,1
but this kinda felt different,1

Long story not exactly short Ive had Celiac disease all my life,1
found out about it in high school,1
really didnt take my diet seriously until very recently,1
Im pretty sure this is where most of my GI complications come from even though Im strict about my diet now,1
theres two and a half decades worth of damage done to my gut at this point,1
Over the last year,1
Id been having odd symptoms that my doctor quite frankly shrugged off,1
Assumed it was just a weird Celiac thing,1
In October,1
things went very downhill very fast,1
I ended up in the ER,1
and discovered I needed my gallbladder removed,1
Had the thing taken out on November th,1

Ever since,1
Ive been experiencing reflux every single night,1
and I am absolutely miserable,1
My symptoms include    Feeling stomach contents backing up into my esophagus,1
though  of the time it doesnt burn like acid   Insane amounts of gas buildup in my stomach that struggles to release,1
need to take Gas-X andor get up and walk to coax it out   Tasting that weird acid flavor on the back of my tongue  Persistent cough and lung irritation  Soreirritated throat   Occasional sensation like something is stuck down at the base of the esophagus   Not sure if related,1
but my eyes have been getting really red and irritated around the time of bad flare-ups,1
 Post nasal drip  Little gurgling noise and feeling in throat as gas escapes without a belch   Producing too much saliva I think Ive read that this is called water brash,1
It felt like this was helping at first,3

However after being on relevant medication nothing seems to be,3
After looking into LPR I was actually surprised at how many of the symptoms she had,1
No burning,1
but a constant intense heavy feeling on her chest,1
constant breathless which seems to get worse almost like an attack at random times but also after eating without fail,1
Shes been complaining about post nasal drip and phlegm,1
and we had actually noticed for awhile before all this kicked off that she had been having issues with hoarseness and excessive throat clearing,1
She also has a kind of muscle soreness just below her ribs,1
and seems unable to be able to breath into her stomach at all,1
The breathlessness is constant now and despite her vitals being fine she constantly feel as though shes dying,1
I definitely think anxiety exacerbates the symptoms,1
however I do not think its the cause,1
Its hard to make life style changes at her age,1
even before the breathlessness she had trouble moving around and exercise is impossible,1
She also doesnt drink coffee or smoke,1

or aura I think is the right word for it,1
which will immediately jolt me up,1
because I know that exact feeling is what can lead into a full seizure,1
I struggle describing the feeling exactly,1
like this intense rising sensation,1
and I have to really try and focus on just being able to breathe,1
and to get to the the other side of it,1
But sometimes I dont get to the other side,1
and I suddenly find I physically just cant get another breath in,1
and cant even move a single muscle as hard as I try,1
And then suddenly Im falling back into the mattress,1
completely not in control of my body,1
I might try and yell out for help in panic,1

this has existed their whole life  Never feeling rested when they wake up regardless of how much time they sleep for,1
Being consistently tired throughout the day,1
 Having a conscious awareness of their brainbody stopping breathing as theyre falling asleep,1
When sleeping next to them Ive also witnessed them not breathing in the middle of the night for - seconds and then gasping and catching their breath,1
Theyve done an at home sleep test that didnt find anything but are going in for an in person overnight sleep test in a couple months hoping to catch what seems like central sleep apnea  They have intense night sweats,1
There has been some weeks where it was so intense it soaked through their mattress and caused molding,1
Theyve since replaced their mattress and added a waterproof cover,1
Though not as bad as that phase they still have noticeable wet spots on their pillow and underneath where they were sleeping that is obvious on dark sheets,1
 A consistent and intense craving for carbs,1
Particularly very simple pasta with only salt,1
olive oil,1
and parmesan,1
and intense feelings of hunger when they dont eat pasta or a similar carb every day,1
 A consistent and intense need to drink lots of water,1
They consume easily - times as much water as youre supposed to on a daily basis and feel terrible if they dont drink this much water,1
They have had this hyper thirst their whole life,1
 An intense feeling of dehydration when they consume even a sip of something alcoholic,1
so they never drink alcohol,1
But test that this symptom still exists by sipping my drinks once in a while,1
 They have felt noticeably better after taking an electrolyte solution in the morning Liquid IV drink some of these symptoms have also had us consider POTS  They have some slight urinary incontinence  They have what they call hyper weakness that appeared within the last year or two  They bruise very easily and find pokes or pushing on their body,1

i lie so well its frightening,1
very manipulative  i can fake just about anything,1
and im very convincing,1
i can fake everything from emotions if i want to,1
even panic attacks,1
i can cry on cue even when i have absolutely no reason to,1
i have very violent thoughts sometimes and sometimes i daydream about them  i can go from thinking i love a person to wanting to brutally kill them in the most horrid way possible in  seconds  i get agitated very easily and when i do i start to think violently  i think taking advantage of other people means im powerful,1
and that theyre just idiots,1
i do feel love,1
and i do feel sorrow,1
im capable of feeling affection so i dont think im a psychosociopath,1
i love my mother somewhat,1
my brother and sister,1
but i cant say i havent thought of brutally killing them to be completely honest because sometimes they annoy me so much and i fantasize about killing them,1
i know i wont really ever kill anyone or anything in complete honesty,1
and i do love my brother,1
mother and sister,1
i have bouts of rage,1
like when my pet irritated me i threw it to a wall and i thought of breaking each of its limbs and torturing it to death,1
but i did feel guilty afterwards,1
i have no sense of identity,1
i disassociate almost all the time and all in all i genuinely have no idea who i am,1
i dont think im capable of feeling whole,1

Am I hallucinating or is this,2
Ive suspected that I have POTS or some type of dysautonomia for over  years,1
Im currently in the process of getting a diagnosis,1
My symptoms would come and go over the years,1
Then i got COVID at the end of December and after my cough went away it felt like my POTS symptoms got worse,1
Two weeks before getting COVID i was having nerve pain as well,1
So i know COVID didnt cause it,1
But sadly it may have made it worse,1
Im out of work currently because my symptoms are getting so bad its,1

then the next month you take  days of meds,2

  I know that Im not supposed to let MS take my joy like its taken so much else,1
but here I am,1
The frustrating thing is that the change is so slight to outsiders,1
even to me,1
But the changes are still there,1
Its this constant cloud hanging over me,1
like how every time I wake up and feel a scratch in the back of my throat I remember that even though I got a positive COVID test back three weeks ago,1
my body still hasnt completely recovered because Im immunocompromised,1
If I feel extra fatigued after a long day,1
I start rifling through my activities,1
wondering what could have possibly made my legs so sore,1
and then I remember that sometimes just going through a day makes me stiff and sore like Id done a rigorous exercise,1
That swallowing thing is a real bitch,1
People dont realize how alarming it is to expect your throat to just do what it always does and send the food back and down your gullet only for there to be no motion,1
and for the act of swallowing to become mechanical,1
like writing out specific instructions to your throat on how to do its job,1
But really,1
its not about the swallowing,1
or the night sweats,1
or being constantly sick,1
or the tingling and the numbness,1
or the fatigue,1
Its about the degeneration,1
Its about the fact that every time I show a symptom,1
Im reminded that my body has attacked that delicate myelin sheath around my nerves and that that process will continue,1
even if its slowed down by,1
How am I supposed to ever be okay,2
with that,0
Mom said that someday the treatments wont be so hard on me emotionally,0
She says it to make me feel better because she doesnt like to see anyone in pain,0
And the most difficult part of this whole thing is that nothing helps,1
Im beyond grateful for my doctors and the treatments and everything,1
but Im so sick of what all these people do to try to make me feel better about it,1
The constant flow of,1
its such a different disease,1
and but youll still have a future,1
and at least they caught it early sometimes makes me just want to scream,1
All of thats true,1
and I know its true,1
But pretty please,1
dont fucking tell me that again because its what I repeat to myself over and over and over again every time I feel myself starting to feel angry or upset about the disease,1
I promise,1
Ive heard it before,1
I promise,1
none of it takes away the disease,1
It increases the shame and guilt over my refusal to take it,1

I would feel so fatigued,1
My chest hurt constantly and I felt pressure and some type of gargling at the top of my stomach,1
For some time I became paranoid thinking it was cancer or that I had hurt myself somehow,1
but every time I mentioned it to my doctor he would dismiss it as allergies and attribute the irritation to post nasal,1

Already taking sleeping pills but I can only sleep for  to  hours with them,1
I have felt somewhat fatigued since November last year but since January its just gotten worse,1
Right now I cant even work from home anymore because I cant sit for  hours,1
When the fatigue is really bad  I can do nothing but lie,1
When I dont feel fatigued I feel jittery and have the urge to move even though I dont have much energy,1
I also sweat very easily but feel really cold when I go outside,1
Right now I spend most of the time lying down,1

End of life trauma,0

Pollan chronicles a study where end stage cancer patients were given psilocybin therapy to help them cope with the anxiety and depression surrounding their death,0

I am I kicking myself for it,1
Since then,1
Ive had weird feelings in my throat and sometimes chest,1
Not pain exactly,1
but discomfort,1
Sometimes it feels like I have a lump in my throat or like I need to burp really badly,1
Sometimes there is a mild burning sensation,1
Sometimes it feels like my esophagus is being constricted,1
but I think that might be due to the anxiety that this situation is causing,1
One night I got really anxious and then my throatchest got tight and hurt more,1
but when I calmed down it felt better,1
The symptoms feel better or worse depending on what I eat and how much I eat,1

So Ive been diagnosed with epilepsy for a little bit over  or  years,1
Im on keppra and clobazam but I dont think it helped,3
I feel my epilepsy remains,1
So there were a few instances where I think I had grand mal,1
You see,1
on my break after the first half of my classes,1
I went to the toilet to take a shit,1
But just as I was about to get out,1
I suddenly woke up on my bed,1
next to a bunch of paramedics and my parents,1
I was hella confused,1
Turns out I passed out in my toilet n my parents got me out,1
I was then sent to the hospital,1
Another instance I suspect was a grand mal was when I was almost done with my tuition and then I vomited out of the blue and then again woke up on my bed,1
my last memory then was that I vomited,1
but I wouldnt have remembered that if my parents didnt mention about the dirt on my bedroom floor,1
This was the most recent and scariest one,1
So I was playing video games casually with my brother and cousin,1
I felt very relaxed and normal but then again,1
I woke up to a bunch of paramedics with medical supplies,1
This time my brother,1
cousin and parents witnessed my seizure,1
They said they thought I was just stretching my hand out at first,1
but then I started trembling and I was moving every part of my body all at once,1
This led to them thinking it was a prank until I stopped moving and fainted on the floor,1
they said my eyes were rolled all the way up and all they could see were the whites and the veins,1
At the hospital,1
all they did was contact my previous neurologist who was on a vacation so this lead me nowhere but to believe my condition is getting worse,1

All of a sudden I went to reach for the puck no one was near me I froze couldnt control my body fell on my back massive headache for a second or ,1
but as soon as I hit the ice I passed out,1
Apparently I was shaking,1
convulsing from my mouth,1
hands were blue from lack of oxygen and I was unresponsive,1
I was out for minutes I woke up,1
I went to work the next day carpenter,1
would have times of the day where I was slightly dizzy,1
definitely didnt have my  balance or hand eye,1
or memory,1
Was like that all week,1
I didnt have to wear my mask at work but I went grocery shopping on the weekend and I found it extremely uncomfortable wearing a mask I definitely wasnt getting  oxygen or something,1
I work mon-fri,1
so I decided to go to the gym Saturday,1
I was working out my upper body and  minutes in maybe I noticed I was slightly dizzy I kept going it slowly got worse than after mins it was pretty bad almost fell like I really could have lost my balance,1
So I left,1
drove home slowly got less dizzy was fine enough to drive,1
Doctor hadnt said I couldnt drive at this point said I was fine,1
I decided not to go to hockey on Sunday the week after dec th because I wasnt  even though I was allowed to play doctor didnt say I,1
I worked the next  days tues wed,1
Was off Thursday I slept in decided not to go to the gym take it easy watched TV most of the day around pm I decided to go in the basement grab my hockey stick and play around with a ball,1
I got a little dizzy at the start but it wasnt as bad as when I was at the gym the other day so I kept going,1
After about minutes in my body locked up I was shaking a bit I knew it was happening again,1
I wanted to kneel down but I had no control over my body,1
Then I eventually fell face first on the ground my right shoulder and just above my nose is what I hit first on cement floor,1
I woke up in my bed which was up  floors wondering what the fuck I was doing in my bed at around pm with shoulder pain,1
After about a good minutes of being confused wondering why I was laying in my bed I remembered I had a seizurein the basement,1
these times arent accurate I never really looked at the time when this happened I dont remember getting up off the basement floor,1
Last thing I remembered is falling on my face then waking up in my bed,1
I called my mother and said I had another seizure then I got in my car and drove to the hospital which was minutes away,1
They checked my blood and everything again same as the first time,1
only thing that was different is they said my electrolytes or something was abit low so they gave me something that tasted kind of like Gatorade,1
The doctor said I should take anti seizure pills and stay away from,1
Ever since the first seizure I have about  of my energy,1
memory hand eye and,1
Ever since I started taking  anti seizure pills a day I have noticed I havent been dizzy at all and wearing a mask lack of oxygen wasnt as bad as I went to the grocery store after my first seizure,3
Today jan  Ive noticed armpit odor,1
knee pain,1
I get flashes on chest pain more to my right side,1
Ive got Flashes of headaches but not for a couple,1

stutter frequently which I always have problems with but I noticed its a bit worse since the first seizure,1
I have adhd or something Im very quiet frequent depression and mental health,1
should I play hockey soon or lightwork out at the gym soon,2
How long will i not be able to,2

Wondering if anyone has had a similar symptom because of possible constipation,2
I was on a medication for  months that could cause constipation and during that time I randomly had a huge stabbing pain one night in my right lower quadrant,1
I couldnt stand,1
bend over,1
walk for a few hours,1
Anytime I moved the pain radiated in my right hip area and a little behind my hip lower back just by the hip,1
I thought my appendix burst but I decided to wait it out,1
I ended up using the bathroom and I felt better hours after that but the aching feeling took a day or two to completely go away,1
Its been over a year since that occurred and the pain sometimes comes and goes,1
Its never been as bad as it was the first time but I can still feel it sort of ache,1
Sometimes when it happens I can feel it get irritated if my jeans are too tight and if Im sittingI bend my right leg up to my chest only on the right side in this one spot,1
My doctor doesnt think its my appendix  said trust me youd know if your appendix burst,3
He also felt in the area during my annual visit and there was no pain there,3
therefore he ruled out it being anything but constipation pains,3
Im wondering if I should make an appointment and recheck the area,2
It gives me anxiety when I read things online and I wonder if it could be something more especially when it feels irritatedachy if I buckle my jeans,3
like what if theres something there,3
I cant physically feel anything like a ball or anything of that,3

I am plagued every single day by unrelenting nausea,1
reflux and anxiety due to food,1
I cannot go out to eat at restaurants because I spend half the time at the table trying not to throw up and the other half in the bathroom feeling miserable or actually dry reaching in the sink,1
Nausea has been my number one unbearable,1
I am not an anxious person and I never have been,1
It has been a steady decline ever since my GERD symptoms began,1
and it is currently the worst it has ever been,1
A tiny butterfly feeling in my stomach in any situation seems to be driven into overdrive and my body reacts in ways my mind doesnt understand,1
The only way I can describe it is the physical manifestation of anxiety without the mind component of stressoverthinking,1
I take mg of Pantoprazole every day which helps with most of the mild daily symptoms like the burning feeling in my throat,3
but it doesnt seem to protect me from flares and other symptoms,3
Taking Domperidone mg prior to meals helped slightly but my eating schedule of small frequent meals made it tricky to incorporate in every day,3
I tend to be spontaneous with eating food so my nausea doesnt have time to catch up,1
I cough uncontrollably every time after I eat substantial meals,1
bringing up phlegm that I feel like Im choking on unless I hack it up,1
I suffer from constipation daily,1
and diarrhoea during flares,1
Ive lost nearly all interest in food,1
I no longer enjoy eating and I dont look forward to any meals,1
I cannot eat a normal full sized meal without throwing up and need to stick to small frequent snacks,1
This mindset change is so different from who I used it be,1
I used to love travelling and eating amazing foods all over the world before Covid but now that seems like my current worst nightmare,1

today   The next one was when I was ,1
I was under a lot of stress,1
having just recently moved in with my sister to get some space from my mother,1
  I was alone in the house,1
starting a load of laundry upstairs,1
I finished what I was doing and started to walk back downstairs but on the nd step down,1
I felt like the wind got knocked out of me,1
Suddenly my heart took off running,1
I sat down on the stairs,1
it kept going,1
I laid down on the stairs and my heartbeat started to reverberate through my body to the edge of convulsions,1
I managed to get to my phone to call my mom and get her to come take me to the hospital,1
She instructed me on how to check my pulse but didnt tell me what a normal BPM was,1
I miscounted my pulse on my own,1
but I thought my count of bpm must mean fast,1
because it felt,1
But in the last  months Ive had  episodes and both times have happened similarly to that last one,1
Except for the drama,1
I was doing a couple things around the house before bed,1
folding laundry and making the bed,1
As soon as I finish up I crawl into bed and as soon as my head hits the pillow BAM its like Ive been punished in the chest,1
I sit back up and its not getting better I lay down for half a second but its painful so I get up and grab my blood pressure cuff and check my numbers,1
Im firmly in the -bpm range and hypertensive for at least mins,1
I was so close to having my husband take me to the hospital because I was starting to feel faint and nauseous,1
He had me lay down in the bed for at least mins so see if that would help,1
As soon as my head hit the pillow again,1
it was like a splash of cold water,1

I was  years old and in my second year of University studying Civil Engineering when i got very sick with mono at the start of a new,1
I battled the sickness for just over a month before i began to feel better but it had set me a bit back with my work and I was pretty screwed heading into midterms in what was a very heavy loaded semester,1
so i was stressed the fuck out but I studied my ass off and made it,1
The next day I had experienced my very first seizure,1
I took every test there was in the hospital and nothing showed epileptic activity in my brain,1
They concluded that what happened to me was the perfect storm and that given i had just come off mono,1
was under a lot of stress,1
low on sleep and especially with the amount of alcohol I had in my system that it all factored,1
I was taking Dilatin for  months and then weened off after,1
They said I shouldnt drink like that ever again,1
or I could be at risk of another,1
For almost  years I watched myself when i drank,1
but my group of friends and I have always been sort of big drinkers since high school,1
and we would drink almost every weekend,1
I never let myself get to the same point I was at that night in ,1
but I would still drink more than just a couple beers and be fine,1
so over time I started to get more comfortable again with drinking more,1
In October ,1
under almost identical circumstances as the first time,1
I had another seizure after a night out of binge drinking and after recovering from a rough cold all while in the middle of midterms,1
This seizure wasnt nearly as bad but I had an aura it was coming the morning I woke up hungover,1
I was put back on Dilatin for  months afterwards and then I was told by my neurologist that since I had another one I should start on Keppra  mg daily,1
and it was my choice if i wanted to but he wouldnt write a letter to get my drivers license back if I wasnt on it,1
After being on Keppra for a week I was experiencing bad side effects and decided to ween myself off taking them since I constantly felt like shit and thought they were unnecessary,3
 days after I had stopped taking the meds altogether,3
I had my most recent seizure earlier this week,3
Now im back on Keppra  mg daily and trying my best to adjust to the meds since its official i need to be on them long term,3
since Im committing to Keppra for the long run,2

Im M and overweightheavy drinker,1
After getting married a few months ago I decided it was time for some changes and went to my PD for the first time in years,1
Had gained about lbs since going when I was  and told the doctor I had been drinking about  days,1
My liver enzymes were about  times elevated,1
In the weeks since then Ive lost about  pounds and had quit drinking on weekdays and doing moderate exerciseeating a much healthy dietwhich did include a lot of chicken and,1
fish  About two weeks ago I woke up thinking I had broken my ankle,3
After suffering for a few days I went to urgent care thinking I had a blood clot or something and they told me it was gout,3
Prescribed me prednisone and hydrocodone,3
I started feeling better within a day and was pretty much back to normal by the following week,3
However I have another flare up now and cant walk again,1
Im trying to go to see my PD because Im not sure if I should really be taking prednisone and hydrocodone with my high liver,1
Ive seen a lot of talk about colchicine and,0
great  Literally  days later I started having more panic attacks and then the GERD began,1
Literally everything I ate or drank set my chest on fire then Id start to get waves of pressure from my belly to my chest,1
Havent pooped in like  days,1
resting heart rate has been stuck at  and Ive lost  pounds in a week,1
Went to the ER because the burning and pressure was so bad and turns out my BP was like  something,1

Ive been on Omeprazole but the jitters makes me feel like shit and like the muscle spasms hurt so bad and my heart beats out of my chest for like an hour so I stopped taking it,3

I was diagnosed with POTS  years ago following a TBI,1
Ive tried any and every prescription medication my many doctors have recommended,1
but without sustained success,1
For the last couple of years Ive tried a few different natural things to alleviate some of my symptoms with magnesium and L-theanine being the most helpful new agents thus far,3
Of course,3
this is in addition to fluids,3
minimal to moderate exercise,3
best effort for quality sleep,3
and eating small meals throughout the,3
Last year I tried microdosing mushrooms to hopefully curb anxiety and lift depression and brain fog,3
I actually had some success but ran out after one month,3
Starting next week,1

and when it happened,1
my girlfriend at the time left me a few months later,1
she told me it wasnt because of this,1
but I have always thought it was because her behavior changed since I explained it to her,1
  Since then,1
I have always lived with the anguish that I dont know at what moment to tell someone I am getting to know emotionally that I have CF,1
and many times I end up distancing myself because I prefer not to have this conversation,1
because I am afraid of living a situation like this again,1
  I have gone through a devastating stage for my mental health,1
but with the passage of time and thanks to therapy I am becoming more and more,1
I have a lot of POTS symptoms during the day,1

Some weird things Ive felt  ,1
Sudden strong pain in my upper left collarbone,1
and neck area,1
Comes on suddenly,1
worst is over within ten minutes  but the area remains sore for a while,1
I usually go lay down immediately and try not to panic,1
General soreness and tightness in the muscles of my left shoulder and upper left chest and back,1
Occasionally in my upper left arm down to the shoulder,1
Makes me fidget a lot trying to get comfortable in bed,1
and I catch myself tugging on my shirt like its too tight on me,1
The occasional,1
more weird and unnerving than painful feeling of something in my chest esophagus maybe being pinched shut or something,1
Very strange,1
As for other symptoms,1
there was one night where I woke up with acid in my throat,1
That was unpleasant but not as scary as the chest pains,1
Sure burned for a while though,1
Besides that,1
pain and discomfort are my only,1
Does any of this sound familiar to you guys,2
I followed the docs instructions and after  days I had run out of Indomethacin and was still limping around,3
so I called my primary physician,3
Pain wasnt at the initial flare level where even a sheet bothered my big toe but it was bad enough that I wasnt sleeping great and still couldnt get around,3
  Primary Doc saw me,3
did a blood test ,3
 uric acid,3
gave me two shots steroid and pain,3
and prescribed Allo and Indomethacin with the Allo starting  days later,3
Later that day the shots had REALLY,3
I see so many people talk about flares when starting Allo but Im hopeful that since this was my first and only attack its less likely to occur,2

in my case I always had drug induced psychosis,1
I started with really heavy drugs and it was the worse experience ever,1
I use to see people but they didnt exist,1
I use to hear voices that commanded me to do things,1
I could not understand where I was and what I was doing,1
There are many other symptoms but I wont write them because it can be really triggering,1

Update after  months since this post I took mg of omeprazole every other morning for  weeks and I stop taking it after that,1
Feel a bit of tingling sensation in my neck every time I reduced the dosage but the sensation went off after a while,1
My diet is back to pre LPR,1
I eat everything now including what was impossible just a few months ago such as tomatoes,1
pizzas and salad with vinegar dressing,1
Coffee and chocolate has no effect on me as well,1
Occasionally I do get some slight sensation coming back so I will take Gaviscon occasionally and the sensation will,1

no fizzy drinks or sodas,3
I must say life is a good as it gets now  Late s and non smoker and occasional alcohol,3

By end April ,3
the symptoms were at its worst with heartburn feeling on the worst days,3
For the st  months from May to July,3
the symptoms were getting better though the healing was painfully slow but its more of a roller coaster ride with ups and downs,3
By August,3
my symptoms of were much improved though I accidentally ate some trigger food that took me - weeks to recover after each episode,3
By October,3
I was mostly symptom free and I started to wean off omeprazole evening dose in November,3
i am only taking mg omeprazole every  days and is still staying symptom free though if I eat too much of a trigger food,3
some mild symptoms will come back for a day,3
I believe I will need another  months for a full recovery,3
I did the following interventions,3
Acid Watcher Diet After reading Dr Jamie Koufman and Dr Jonathan Avivs books,3
I figured my LPR was due to downing too many bottles of yogurt drink and iced tea throughout the day for the past  years,3
These iced tea,3
are acidified with citric acid so I  avoid them totally now,3
For my diet,3
I eliminated coffee,3
citrus foods,3
vinegar for the past few months,3
spicy food,3
cooked garlic and onion has no trigger effect on me,3
Tomatoes is the worst culprit,3
I ate a tomato stew and the symptoms came back immediately when I was in the midst of the recovery phase,3
I bought a alkaline water pitcher and tested the pH to be above  and has been drinking only alkaline water since then,3
I want to stress that during the initial recovery,3
there is no shortcut to the diet,3
u need to stick to it,3
If u cheat,3
the symptoms will come back and it will delay your healing by a,3
easily as there was how long it takes for the symptoms to go after I ate a trigger food,3
Medication I took  doses of mg omeprazole everyday for  months before I started to wean off slowly last month,3
I cant say I notice any significant effect on myself but I prefer to take this since it is just temporary for half a year,3
I switch to rabeprazole halfway for  weeks and I got symptomatic relief but it was too expensive to eat this for  months so I switched back to omeprazole,3
I know many mention that taking this has long term side effects but I feel taking it for  months is absolutely alright since the benefit outweigh the risk by making the reflux less acidic,3
giving your esophagus and throat a chance to heal,3
I have to take this for more than a year or lifetime,3
I will hesitate,3
I also took Gaviscon Advance in addition to omeprazole if my symptoms were really bad These days,3
I will take ml at night before I sleep as I notice I will wake up with a sore throat if I dun take it,3
Planning to wean off in the months to come,3
I also tried to make my own Gaviscon by mixing alginate,3
sodium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate and it works as well as I tested it by pouring into a cup of vinegar,3
formed a mesh thick layer that floated on top of the vinegar,3
similar as well when I pour the same amount of Gaviscon to the vinegar,3
The homemade version is definitely way cheaper but it can be a hassle to make it since u need to weigh the powders,3
give it a good stir with water before you drink it,3
Lifestyle I eat a smaller meal and eat a lot less carbohydrates these days such as rice,3
bread and pasta since it cause bloatedness,3
I realise the,3

Common experience,2
One of his main symptoms is head pressure,1
and was initially diagnosed with  lesions in his brain and a cluster in his thoracic spine but there hasnt been any increase in number of lesions since hes been diagnosed,1
One way weve found to relieve his head pressure he feels is literally me massaging his neck where his veins and arteries are located,3
The most difference is made by massaging the smaller vein,3
He says he feels instant relief and often feels a tingling sensation over his entire body like his body is waking up,3
He also says it feels like the flow is back and a flushing like experience in his brain,3

I am currently in eating disorder recovery so I cant go on any diets or anything now but when I was actively dieting I did keto a number of times,3
My IBS symptoms went away every single time,3
my moms did as,3
Has anyone else had this happen and what could be the cause,2
I know its not specifically being keto but what did I cut out while eating an extremely low carb diet that makes IBS,2
I am wondering if someone could perhaps help,1
I am  years old who has constant palpitations,1
a heavy thumping heart that is regular in rhythm for ,1
The main problem is that I cant get deep sleep because my heart pounds so,1
I have had standard blood tests and scans that show my heart is,1
My cardiologist does not believe this is anxiety related and beta blockers dont,1
I came across POTS and did the test going from lying to,1
My heart rate jumped from  to  within - seconds looking at my fitbit,1
and I got light headed,1
I presume this means I probably have,3
Is there a connection between POTS and constant heart thumpingbounding,2
I think I might have GERD,1
but I dont know if it would cause lightheadedness ,1
I also have other stuff that you would think would make GERD worse,3
but in fact helps such as wearing a corset or something else very tightly around the waist or holding a pillow to my stomach helps ease the stomach pain,3
and chewing gum makes things much worse even though articles online say the saliva formed helps ease symptoms,3
The thing is,1
my understanding of heartburn has been that its like an isolated symptom of the burning feeling up your esophagus,1
and it wouldnt trigger lightheadedness  dizziness,1
It seems like avoiding certain triggers does seem to help,1
like I had to stop eating spaghetti and meatballs because of the high carb pasta and the acidity from the tomatoes,1
I deal with frequent hunger that feels like a sharpacidic gnawing pain behind my sternum that makes me want to curl into a ballguard my stomach,1
I get gurgling in the back of my throat and the nerves down my arms to my fingers start,1
Smoking weed also makes this acidic feeling  lightheadedness much worse and lead to me fainting at one point so I ended up having to unfortunately stop smoking,3
These symptoms get worse when I eat something loaded with carbs like candy or fruit or a bagel,1
I even have troubles with eating a salad on an empty stomach,1
They get better when I make sure to eat something low carb  protein filled with some fats,1
like chicken and brussel sprouts,1
Or if I eat a massive amount at one point,1
like a chipotle burrito bowl will keep the symptoms at bay for a few hours,1
I cant go more than a couple of hours without eating unless I eat a giant portion,1
and even then depending on what I eat like if its a bread  berries  nuts  cheese charcuterie board I will need to eat something in like  minutes,1
Do I have,2

 days ago i started felling depressed,1
im going trough mixed emotions,1

I never felt like that before trikafta so im pretty sure its from the notorious side effects,1
I didnt notice any other side effects surprisingly besides those emotions,1

I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone and thank you for your support through my diarrhea and confusion these past few,1
I went to my doctor as Ive been burping air a lot for the past three months,1
I burp when I drink water,1
I burp when my stomach is empty,1
and basically all day,1
This all started on the th of September,1
On the th of September I swallowed a piece of bread to hard and developed a clicking throat,1
Which means the muscles were clicking whenever I swallowed saliva or food,1
I got scared to swallow because of this,1
and started to swallow differently,1
like more convulsive,1
And I chew every small bite,1
untill there is basically nothing left to swallow and my jaw is tired,1
Two days later the burping and gurgling and rumbling started in my throat and esophagus and stomach,1
I wasnt worried about it,1
as I thought this was caused by me swallowing the wrong way,1
So I believed it was caused by anxiety and aerophagia,1
The clicking sensation in my throat thankfully went away slowly after like two months,1
And so did the burping and rumbling,1
But whenever I eat Im still terrified,1
Im worried that my throat will click again,1
or that food will end up in my windpipe,1
And I still take small bites and keep chewing untill there is basically nothing left to swallow,1
so the burping returned,1
but this time I also got a tickle in my throat and developed a sore throat and a bad,1
After two weeks,1
I was still,1
Its been  weeks now,3
Famotidine is still not helping,3
is Is this really acid reflux caused by some sphincter,2
Burping because of anxiety and aerophagia Considering I burp so much,1
it obviously irritates my throat And for sure all the burping causes a little bit of acid to reflux up all the way into my throat,1
So if I got rid of the burping,2
the acid reflux and throat issues would also go away,2
Why cant this be possible,2
Why is excessive burping always,2

I go to the bathroom during work just to make myself throw up and then I feel better,1

I feel so sick and dirty on the inside sometimes I feel like its the only way I will become clean,1
No idea how to express this to anyone,1
Every time I eat I think about the pros and cons of vomiting it back up,1
Often its just too much effort and I dont want to get my hands slimy,1
Sometimes I just dont eat so I wont feel awful about it later and have to get it out,1

to the point where Ive had family members or friends at sleepovers tell me that I was so still they had to check that I was breathing,1
Ive done tests before,1
balancing certain objects and what-not so I can tell if I move at all during the night,1
and when I wake up in the morning theyre almost never moved in the slightest,1
Its also incrediblyyy difficult to wake me up,1
Ive slept through multiple alarm clocks ringing,1
intense storms,1
fire alarms,1
people yelling at me,1
Its become somewhat of a joke between my family and I,1
When Im asleep I stay asleep,1
Recently though,1
Ive been noticing that when I wake up in the morning,1
all of the stuff on my bed has been knocked off,1
I also wake up completely exhausted,1
and no matter how much sleep I get Im still groggy,1
Ive been realllllly stressed out with school and work,1
so I theorized that maybe Ive just been having more dreams than usual that I cant remember,1
or that Ive just been more restlessanxious in general,1
and its reflecting when Im asleep,1
I also had a thought that I might be sleepwalking again,1
I havent been caught sleepwalking since middle school,1
To be on the safe side,1
I asked my family to just keep an eye out at night,1
and told them that if they happen to hear or see anything,1
to just let me know,1
last night happened,1
I was bone-dead tired after taking two finals and staying up to finish a project,1
and so when decided to go to bed I figured I would knock out with no issues,1
I had a slight headache,1
so I drank some water and settled down for the night,1
I had a movie playing in the background as I dozed off,1
I dont remember falling asleep,1
but what I do remember was,1

I went into an urgent care clinic mid January because I was experiencing the most severe dizzinessdisorientation I had ever felt before along with this tingling numbness on the right side of my face and severe lack of balance,1

does low lesion count equate to lower disease,2
I understand that lesion location plays a critical role in this and whether or not it is symptomatic,2
but is it generally considered that the fewer lesions you have the better you are doing,2

My evening meal usually sits on my chest and has been causing chest pain and the feeling of a lump in my throat,1
On Monday I threw up because I was nauseous and felt like the food had to come up,1
My question is has anyone else experienced this post covid,2
And every time I wake up I feel the best and completely zen,1

memories I often have a hard time telling dreams from reality as time goes on because my dreams are so real,1
They never really have things that are fake,1
They always have people I know,1
places I know,1
but theyre always tweaked a bit,1
And over time,1
the places will change more and more,1
which messes with how I actually remember the places,1
The dreams are also super repetitive so it solidifies the thoughts into my mind,1
which makes them feel more real and makes them more like memories,1

On Monday I had my first migraine ever,1
I have never had a migraine before,1
It was distributed all over my head uncommon for a migraine and it even caused neck and back pain,1
I eventually ended up in emergency services somehow and I do not remember half of what happened,1
All I do remember is that my entire head hurt like never before and it was the most pain I have ever experienced,1
and I am comparing this pain to broken bones and torn ligaments,1
I was so light sensitive that I could not see,1
and every little sound hurt,1
I was in emergency services for over  hours while they were running tests,1
Originally they thought it was bacterial Meningitis but after all the tests and consulting with my neurologist they concluded that it was a very severe migraine,1
I have ended up in places where I do not know how I ended up there,1

This is the most pain I have ever experienced and I still feel unwell,1

Im not sure what psychosis is,0
but after looking at some of the stuff,0

like people calling my name,0
my alarms going off,0

I have paranoia a lot,1

but I moved so its not as often,1
I try not to look at vents,1
But I was just wondering what you guys,2
I see shadow people too but I think thats just haunting stuff oh and I have severe anxiety so I always feel like people are watching me and talking about me which I saw somebody else talking about,3
but I was really freaked out for like two months last year because I watched a lot of conspiracy stuff and every time I would go out I swear everyone would stare and look at me with a blank expression on their face n it scared the f out of me,3
I was terrified,3

question  I am currently taking metoclopramide mg to fight off GERD and this is my second time taking it started taking it the Wednesday of Christmas week to today  days,1
My first time taking it was from mid August to stop taking it in early October,1
I only take one mg pill at night everyday with,1
I am already aware that taking this medication for over  weeks is dangerous as it can cause tardive dyskensia,0
How long of a drug holiday do i have to take to reset the cycle of how long i should take this medication before i could possibly develop tardive or does that not exist for this medication,2
Can i even get tardive taking metoclopromide mg long term once a day since it is such a small dosage,2
Who on earth can i call or reach out to for medical advice because NO ONE IS AVAILABLE TO TALK,2

Ive been feeling heartburn or tastes some kind of vinegar feeling from my throat to stomach for months,1
I thought its just nothing because I like spicy foods and foods that is delicious to eat with vinegar,1
so I shrugged it off because I only feel it from time to,1
From the past two-three months I havent eaten spicysour foods or anything thats too spicy or too sour but the taste of vinegar like feel on my tongue or throat never leaves me as well as the burning feeling whenever I eat spicy foods,1
Im not sure if my GERD was caused by spicy or sour foods but what Im sure was it is because of my poor life choices,1
from not eating on time and eating too much on the wrong time where our digestion is at,1
The thing is,1
it got worse a week or two before Christmas is near so I dont get to enjoy eating foods I used to eat every year,1
And by this upcoming New years celebration Ill be controlling what food Ill eat and how much will I consume,1

My Indian teacher thought for a second I was throwing some sort of prank and she proceeds to tell me to get off the ground,1
I couldnt do what she wanted and when Ms,1
Rocky came over she started freaking out and told the woman to call for help,1
She put a pop sickle stick in my mouth to stop me from choking on my own tongue,1
Eventually the nurse and emergency people get there and they carry me out on a gurney meanwhile Im coherent throughout the entire duration but it was as if my mind wasnt in control of my body,1
I remember being loaded into the ambulance and the man told me jus sit back I have  a magic potion to make me go night night,1
Next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital,1

and never lost consciousness,2

The best I had felt in,3
At  weeks,1
I wasnt feeling so hot anymore,1
My joint pain started to become more prominent again,1
but not debilitating,1
I started taking the hydroxychloroquine at this time,1
At week - I was feeling slightly better,3
I thought this was from the,3
At  weeks now I would say my joint pain is at - of the worst its ever been,1
Its difficult for me to climb stairs,1

I have lost about  kg in around,1
 months now,1
I have been in a very stressful situation the past - months as well,1
my father had a stroke and then it was found that he had lung cancer,1
this put a lot of stressburden on myself as I had to help take care of him and work as well,1
however I dont want to put this all down to just stress just in case its not the cause of whats,1
been happening,1
Im having stomach issues fairly consistently,1
acid reflux,1
anything yet,1
I dont appear to be gaining weight back,1
over the past  weeks I dont really appear to be losing much more weight and if so,1
barely any,1
But I am finding after waking up,1
I seem to have lost a lot of weight,1
then kind of put it back on but I think thats mostly,1
water weight,1
I kinda feel like its cancer speeding up my metabolism,1
Sometimes I feel like not eating much but thats not not very often at all,1
but thats due to the stomach issues,1
but for the most part I am still eating,1
not getting any food stuck in my throat,1
any of that,0
I dont take NSAIDs as I read that can cause,0
I feel like my feet is vibrating can this be due to,2

help Im so worried if its acid reflux or I have Covid,1
I started out with an uncomfortable tightnesspressure in the center of my chest,1
and felt like something was pulsing or about to jump out of my esophagus,1
Now my chest hurts a bit,1
And I keep belching up air from my stomach which makes me choke so I end up hacking up mucus,1
For context,1
I pretty much ate xxtra spicy chips and xtra spicy ramen for the past - days before the tightness happened and starved myself late at night until my stomach growled a lot and just went to sleep,1
Could this be the results of,2

Ive been having these pains in my upper left abdomen that comes and goes,2
and it was accompanied with blood in stool at one point,2
Ive consulted the GP and they said its likely IBS and constipation,2
Ive taken laxatives and I havent seen blood in my stool thankfully,2
The pain is bearable,2
just uncomfortable and feels tender,2
But Im still worried because my upper left abdomen always feels heavier and more tender than the right,1
and sometimes it hurts,1
I do get pains across other parts of my belly at random time points particularly after eating but theyre mostly bearable,1
Ive been told IBS symptoms differ for different people,1
but Im still afraid that this pain is something more,1

 years that my symptoms were costochondritis,1
I was told all sorts of bullshit by doctors,1
I didnt feel the acid reflux and my main symptom was tightness in the ribcage,1
sternum pressure and pain near my diaphragm,1
A feeling of shortness of breath as well,1
And a very heavy feeling on the right side of my body,1
near the stomach,1
In fact,1
After the general anesthesia it has gotten worse and my stomach feels like its burning and its so heavy,1
No matter what I eat or if I eat,1
It burns,1

symptoms have worsened,2

And numbness and tingling sensations on my hand and feet since couple of months,1
And recently my right arm feels numb and weak,1

have you found it,2
Why do people think faking seizures is,2
IBS-C Im a M with IBS-C,1
and Ive been having a tremendously difficult time sleeping this last,1
To combat the symptoms I was facing,3
the doctor recommended me Linzess first the mg dosage but the last two weeks Ive been on the mg for reasons Ill get too soon,3
It worked well for the first two weeks or so,3
but then I started running into issues,3
For starters,3
the Linzess just did not work as intended,3
Even drinking more then the recommended water intake per day,3
adding daily usage of Mirilax,3
as well as changing my diet accordingly,3
nothing would have me go to the bathroom,3
other then violent diarrhea once a week which essentially would leave me in pain and unable to function during that day,3
In addition,3
I would also feel bloated,3
cramped and get these horrible bouts of acid reflux which during periods of constipation tends to come in and out at random times,3
I know Linzess is a pretty polarizing medication and a lot of users on this sub seem to be split on how affective it is,3
I assumed that my dosage needed to be higher,3
So I switched to the higher dose and all of the problems I had before just intensified,3
The worst development as of late has been cramping,1
and acid reflux pains all hitting at night,1
I find that these issues make me unable to relax and Im currently typing this on the third out of last four days where I am unable to fall asleep due to the factors I just listed,1
I have reduced my diet to a very strict low FODMAP,1
even eating many hours before bed,1
but this does not seem to quell anything,1
Im perpetually tired and unable to even enjoy going out for a walk due to both fatigue and fear that these symptoms will spring up while Im walking,1

months later I start getting some chest pain an a bit of fatigue an dizziness these symptoms were making it hard for me to work labor I continued an had a hard time doing so,1
some months go by an I started getting heachaches an back pains while the chest pains became more,1
so I was put on nortryphiline which is a anxiety med,3
eventually it got so bad I had to quit around this time I started getting bad stomachs pains as well which were never a problem at the start I also started getting weird pains in other unexplained places at this time,3
Im  years old atm  lbs,1
not the best diet I do smoke weed but not cigs or vaping,1

I often feel like I pulled a muscle an its hard to move,1
the location varies from my spine to left shoulder blade,1
the pain can feel dull or more usually a pinching fr  Stomach not as frequent  severerecently my stomach has been very bad,1
in the start it was never an issue now about every second day or so I feel cramping or sharp pains in various locations in my stomach all day long an its very uncomfortable   Fatigue an dizziness frequent severe I often get very dizzy when standing up I sometimes lose around  percent of my vision for a few seconds and also get headaches as well as a heavy feeling in my chest,1
