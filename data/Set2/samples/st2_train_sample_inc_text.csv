(diagnosis limbo)
I honestly just need to vent and maybe get some advice on how to adapt and deal with what Im calling my new life.

Long story short is that Ive been experiencing symptoms since Aug. 2021 that have gotten more pronounced after a two week attack in late Nov/early Dec that brought on more reoccurring symptoms. I had a head MRI without contrast done Dec. 4 that showed several nonspecific lesions that may be secondary to demyelination. I saw a neurologist Dec. 24 who was convinced it was a b12 deficiency but that came back negative. He offered no follow up to me so I had to go do a Seinfeld style pop-in to convince him to reevaluate me.. but now I have to wait until March for that appointment.

In the meantime Im struggling. Havent worked since Dec. 13 and dont think that I can do back to doing a job where Im on the computer all day because that tends to make my unsteadiness and fatigue worse. Now Im trying to find something low stress and with less time on a screen for work.

**TL;DR:** **Besides therapy, can anyone recommend maybe some good books or videos for coping/adapting to chronic symptoms? Ill list below what Im experiencing but the fatigue, brain fog and unsteady type of dizziness are disrupting my daily life.**

Baseline/Persistent Symptoms

* Rocking/unsteady dizziness
* Tingling/numbness in right leg from knee down
* Fatigue like never before
* Brain fog (short term memory, trouble finding words, focus)
* Frequent urination 12-15 times per day (has been going on for a few years and had ultrasound, digital exam and PSA done in 2020 all negative) \*\*Note: these symptoms worsen with the listed triggers below

Infrequent but reoccurring (brought on by triggers listed below)

* Tingling in hands and face
* Tingling in BOTH legs from knee down
* Ringing in one or both ears for 10 secs at a time (usually once a day)
* Headaches (5/10) maybe once every 10 days

Triggers that make symptoms worse

* Poor sleep (if I dont wear CPAP entire night)
* Stress
* Exercise
* Showers?? Make my leg/feet cold and tingly
* Working on the computer (particularly white screen with black text)"

I use to have simple partials and grand mal seizures fairly often about 10 years ago.  I have been under control for almost 8 years by taking Klonopin (very very small dosage) on a daily basis.   I stopped taking the Klonopin 3 different times over the last year and almost immediately had a day full of simple partials.  Every time I went back on it I would be seizure free for months.  

Today I had a break through even while on the Klonopin.  I'm trying to think about what has changed that would make me seizure free for so long and now having a break through.  

My seizures ALWAYS start at night when I'm sleeping.  The only time I'll ever have one during the day is if I started having them the night before. 

I had been smoking pot daily for a very long time but recently quit about 6 months ago.  I know that pot alters your sleep big time, for instance I would never have dreams while I was on pot but now I dream constantly.  Does anyone think that this could play a role or does anyone have any experience with marijuana and seizures?   My doctor is aware of all this and he would give me a medical card if I wanted to ask him."

I'm confused on whats wrong with my stomach, I've known that I gave gastritis for 2 years but it feels different from it because I have a sharp main in my low abdomen and feels like I'm being stabbed. Plus my gastritis only lasts for a few days maybe less, while this has been lasting for 2 almost three months, because ibs is chronic while gastritis dosen't last long. When I fart or burp I get little relief but it reliefs but puts strain on my intestines."
