I havent been officially diagnosed but have been testing for what i thought was a bacterial infection. After talking to some people, they think I may have GERD. Ever since almost a year and a half ago I have had some weird symptoms of bloating, loose stool and feeling nauseous occasionally, but overall my symptoms arent too bad. I dont really get heartburn except for on occasion but I took a test to see what bacteria were present in my mouth/throat. I was told they are all generally normal bacteria, but some of them are typical in the gut which is why they thought it was GERD. 

It has caused me to have swollen taste buds and some whiteness on the tongue that gets better or worse depending on the day (and i assume my diet as well) and when I wake up in the morning I notice I have difficulty breathing. Anyone else have these same problems? More curious about the swollen tastebuds since I see my other symptoms are quite common.

Thanks!"

Before getting admitted to psych ward I had episodes that lasted about 45 minutes during all the week.
I got myself admitted due to thinking of harming myself  opning my arm to let the whatever inside me out.
Now after a week in a hospital without any episodes 
I feel like they were hiding the shadows that I usually see were scared that's why they were hiding now,
Now I feel they are inside me, I feel like i need to open myself to let them free."

Sometimes the CF community in general can get a bit negative, so I just wanted to open up an opportunity for people to share some positive experiences they may have had in relation to CF.

Was there a time someone made a generous accommodation for you to help manage your CF or because of your CF?

Did you have an experience you wouldn't have otherwise had?

Did a relationship take on a different level because of your experiences with CF?

For me, a time that stands out is when I was in Grade 10. I was a hardworking student who had maintained straight A's since starting junior high in Grade 8. I'd been in the hospital several times throughout those 3 years, but had always managed to keep up while I was away. At the end of Grade 10, I was hospitalized at a time when my Math class was just starting a new subject. I studied on my own as best I could, but I missed almost all of the instruction on the subject. When it came time for the test, I got a much lower score than usual, and it put my overall mark down to a B. I mentioned in passing to my Math teacher that I was sad to have my ""streak"" broken. We had a discussion about the subject of the test where she confirmed that I did understand it sufficiently. Without telling me, she went into her records, looked at all my previous test scores, and came up with an average, which is what she assigned me as a score on that final test. This brought my mark back up to an A, and the streak continued! It was such a sweet thing for her to do, and I've never forgotten it. I continued my straight A streak right up to the end of high school and graduated with scholarships to go to university!"

My fellow gout suffers Im 50 years old will be 51 next year Im On no medication but have been getting attacks more frequently.

My dad also suffers from gout and hes on allopurinol for I think the past 30 years and then doing great. 

After learning more about this chronic condition here I noticed a lot of you have gone to a rheumatologist.

After my last outbreak I emailed my doctor my primary care physician and said Id like to get a referral to rheumatologist he told me to come see him and that gout is easy and there is really only three treatments. 

What do you think should I go see him or should I be insistent to see a rheumatologist? Thank you for your help"

What's the best, highest g sugar, most compact treatment option?
Aloha Everyone! I have a question in regards to Diabetes & hypoglycemia treatment.

So, as I have gastroparesis, glucose tabs don't really work that well for me. They take over a half hour to kick in, and I end up overtreating and just go high later on. So I have to drink liquid to treat. Another thing is that I need atleast 40g sugar to treat. So I'm having issues finding compact ways to bring treatment around with me. I normally bring along 2 juice boxes, but I'm want to be wearing a purse instead of a backpack. And I find it hard to save space especially having to carry around glucometer, enzymes and 2 juice boxes. And also glucagon. It's to crammed and can get rather heavy.


Possibly I could make really concentrated sugar water, say 1oz water to 40g sugar, but how would I store that in my bag? And how long would that keep before it goes rancid?


I've looked into those dex glucose liquids, but I would need to have 3 on me at all times, and that seems it would take up the same amount of space as 2 juice boxes already does. Plus they're expensive compared to juice boxes, or home made sugar water.



So my question is what can I bring along with me that had the most g sugar, and is compact, and at the same time will not go rancid quickly?



What's your experience?

Any ideas help!

Thanks in advanced! "

After all of your support and suggestions I was well prepared to tell my neurologist today that Id like to be on Ocrevus, but was planning to continue nursing. 

Before I could get the nerve up to tell her, she actually said Ive been thinking about our last appointment and think I may have scared you without meaning to. While the FDA does not recommend breastfeeding while on Ocrevus, the molecular size makes it difficult to pass into breastmilk, and the minimal amount that could be secreted would be destroyed by the babys gastrointestinal system.  The stress caused by ending nursing before you are ready could be more of a risk factor to be considered.

I want to say THANK YOU to all of you for helping me realize I dont have to choose between my health and this special thing I get to do with my son. I wouldnt have been nearly as prepared for this appointment, and Im so glad my neuro proved herself to be a wonderful doctor, again. :)"
