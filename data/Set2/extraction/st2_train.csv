>A novel therapy, tested ex vivo, has been successful at correcting the dysfunctional body mechanism in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).

>Researchers have discovered how genes that protect against Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) become silent or switched off and have identified a drug to switch them on again.

>POTS is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance as their primary symptom, in which a reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after the person stands up from a lying-down position. A main symptom in a third of POTS patients is fainting. 

>The researchers were from Monash University and led by Professor Sam El-Osta who said that while the gene implicated in POTS  norepinephrine transporter (NET)  had been known for several decades, past research had failed to find a genetic mutation responsible for the symptoms. This latest study revealed that the enzyme EZH2 is responsible for silencing this gene.
