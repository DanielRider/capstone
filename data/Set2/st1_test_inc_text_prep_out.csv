paw773,t5_2syer,Trigger Foods  Diet Understanding medication is the best control I was curious to know what triggers a flare for you vs
paw773,t5_2syer,those foods which dont
paw773,t5_2syer,For example  I am on mg of allo
paw773,t5_2syer,For me prepackaged rice sides KnorrLipton will without question cause a flair due to disodium guanylate
paw773,t5_2syer,There is little nutritional value in these processed foods but it made for a quick meal when on the runor the limp
paw773,t5_2syer,Never again
paw773,t5_2syer,On the other hand I can enjoy a burger
paw773,t5_2syer,and beans with no trouble
paw773,t5_2syer,I will do an occasional steak with no problems either
paw773,t5_2syer,Ditto beerwine
paw773,t5_2syer,Moderation being the key but its worth knowing that gout doesnt have to rule the menuif properly medicated
paw773,t5_2syer,Tonights meal  teriyaki salmon
paw773,t5_2syer,stir fry veggies
paw773,t5_2syer,and brown rice
sk2zb2,t5_2s3g1,Any quick relief remedies for the stomach cramps
scofpi,t5_2saq9,Canker sores Anyone else get them often
scofpi,t5_2saq9,And is it related to pots somehow
rjfn6r,t5_2syer,Any cream recommendations for a Gout flare up
rjfn6r,t5_2syer,I see a lot of different creams on Amazon to manage gout pains but i cant trust any of the reviews
rjfn6r,t5_2syer,Anyone have any luck with over the counter ointments to manage the pain
rv86dh,t5_2s1h9,Paxlovid interactions check with your doctor before you need it
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,No trikafta in Australia yet Hey
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,Any advice would be appreciated
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,Australia still doesnt have trikafta unfortunately and Im suffering badly having upwards of  admissions per year
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,Is there anything that helped you guys significantly before you got trikafta
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,Ive been using CBD oil but as CFers the THC is what actually helps us
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,Of course in Australia its near on impossible to get your hands on oil that has THC in it
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,yup even illegally theres nothing
rrdm8w,t5_2r876,If theres literally anything that has eased your condition drop it in the comments please x
sebhly,t5_2s23e,In the process of being diagnosed
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Already worried about telling family
sebhly,t5_2s23e,this might be a bit of a long one
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and pretty personal
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I know its probably pretty hard to advise on something like this
sebhly,t5_2s23e,but Im supposing almost everyone here has had a similar experience
sebhly,t5_2s23e,And maybe I just want to sound off and vent a little bit
sebhly,t5_2s23e,a week ago I didnt have a clue what MS was
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I went to my doctor to discuss the results of an MRI I expected to come up normal
sebhly,t5_2s23e,only to be told I have lesions that are more than likely MS like
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I cant tell you its MS until you get the contrast MRI and the spinal tap
sebhly,t5_2s23e,but its probably MS
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I had no idea what I was dealing with
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and my mind immediately started thinking about impending doom
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Thank god I found this subreddit
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I now know that its not a death sentence
sebhly,t5_2s23e,that theres hope
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and other people are living with thisyou people are kicking arse and have filled me with so much courage and hope
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Im not scared anymore
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Ive had time over the past week to accept the possibility and get at peace with it
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Maybe Im being unrealistically positive and oversimplifying the issue
sebhly,t5_2s23e,but I feel like whether I stay as I am now minor symptoms that dont really impact my day to day life
sebhly,t5_2s23e,just some fatigue
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and funky vision forever or cant walk in the future
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Ill be okay in the end
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Im almost inappropriately calm
sebhly,t5_2s23e,sorry if that comes across as belittling people with more severe symptoms and effects
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I dont mean it like that at all
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I just feel kind of stupidly content not to worry in advance about my future and meet the challenges as they come
sebhly,t5_2s23e,if that makes sense
sebhly,t5_2s23e,  I dont want to get ahead of myself before Im officially diagnosed
sebhly,t5_2s23e,But the one thing that is weighing on me horribly is the thought of telling my family
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I dont want to say a word until I have the exact information from a neurologist so I can just lay the facts out for the people I choose to tell
sebhly,t5_2s23e,My grandparents my biggest concern
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I guess this whole situation has made me realise what a tight knit family I have
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and how fortunate I am
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Im close as hell with my grandparents and I know theyll probably worry themselves sick if they know about this
sebhly,t5_2s23e,As much as I hope they live another fifty years
sebhly,t5_2s23e,chances are that wont be the case
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and given how mild and easily concealed my symptoms are right now
sebhly,t5_2s23e,theres a good chance it wont be obvious for a number of years I mean
sebhly,t5_2s23e,This is kind of horrible to think about and I feel kind of shit for even writing it down but would it be kinder for me to let my grandparents live out the rest of their lives without having to worry about my health
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Im concerned that it wouldnt be possible to specifically keep it from them
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and that even if I tried
sebhly,t5_2s23e,theyd end up finding out by accident or from someone else
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and potentially a garbled version of the facts rather than hearing it from my very calm mouth
sebhly,t5_2s23e,As for the rest the rest of my family
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I wonder is it better to keep them in blissful ignorance until I cant anymore
sebhly,t5_2s23e,or would that make it worse by giving them no time to get comfortable with the news before Im physically changed
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I live abroad
sebhly,t5_2s23e,so I feel like theyd be insanely worried about me being so far away and also the secret would be easier to keep so maybe it would be better to hold off on it at least for now
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Im overthinking before I even get properly diagnosed
sebhly,t5_2s23e,And its pretty typical of me to get lost in the moral specifics of choices I have to make
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I know I can only do my best to do the right thing at the end of the day
sebhly,t5_2s23e,I guess Im just pouring out all of the thoughts swirling around my head on the matter
sebhly,t5_2s23e,and wondering about all of your experiences on choosing who to tell and how to tell them
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Thank you to everyone whos ever shared their stories and experiences on here
sebhly,t5_2s23e,Youve made the past week a completely different experience for me than it wouldve otherwise been
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,Anyone else get SUPER dizzy and lightheaded when they are sick
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,Ik we all get dizziness and lightheaded
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,but when Im sick even with like a cold its HORRIBLE
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,Like I got so dizzy I could barely walk two feet
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,This happens almost every time I get sick
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,and right now its persisting a day or two even tho I feel a lot better
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,I can hardly read bc my eyes wont focus on the letters
s4xhny,t5_2saq9,I can barely do anything Im just so dizzy and floaty and brain fogged
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,So how do you tell a psychotic belief from a religious one
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,Ive always had this problem
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,where I start believing stuff that is in no way grounded in reality
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,but dont realize its a problem because I can just hand waive it away as a religious belief
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,and end up encouraging my brain to keep doing it
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,Im usually really good at recognizing and dismissing delusional lines of thought
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,But I really want to have some kind of religion in my life
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,if only to ease the terror of knowing the inescapable approach of the void
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,I just dont know how to approach religion in a healthy way
s4zk1r,t5_2tyg2,or if there even is one

qswfc7,t5_2r876,Anyone with experience in this
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9, years seizure-free streak broke So after  years my seizure streak broke
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9,I didnt expect
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9,I didnt take stress
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9,my sleep and diet was fine
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9,My liver tests were a bit out of normal range
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9,but I dont think so that had any effect
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9,My medicine Lamotrigine was fine
rl99jj,t5_2s1h9,Now I always have anxiety that Ill have another seizure
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,This is all new to me I dont really know how to feel about all of this
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I had my first seizure in July of this year
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I say first because it was a full-on seizure where I dont remember anything happening
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,We were able to connect at least two other experiences in my past  years ago as possible seizures mini seizures
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I dont know a term for them but I was fully aware during them
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,my sleep-deprived EEG came back abnormal and my first neurologist started me right away on Briviact
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,My insurance refused to cover it
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,so they were going to switch me to Keppra
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,Then I ended up switching to a neurologist that specializes in epilepsy and he decided I would do better on lamotrigine so now I am weaning off the Briviact and going onto mg lamotrigine per day
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,this all just feels so ridiculous to me but I suppose I am naive and dont know much about epilepsy
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I dont even fully understand my own EEG report
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I ask for timelines if they ever think I can come off the medication and they are not really giving me anything besides you need to be on medication
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I just feel like this is all so blown out of proportion from basically one seizure
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I am also someone who pretty much avoids medication at all costs
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,dont know why
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,but I have always been this way and the thought of taking daily medication for the foreseeable future is freaking me out
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I have read through this forum and see stuff like  days seizure free
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,and I really dont feel like I can relate
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,I had one confirmed episode and suddenly I have epilepsy
reh8yq,t5_2s1h9,Please tell me I am not alone in feeling this way
ssq6fa,t5_2tyg2,Can someone explain to me what psychotic depression is
rsi32t,t5_2syer,What tests should I ask my doctor for to confirm if this is gout or not I have been sober for the past seven months
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I went my hunt camp in November and had  of a shot and two fingers or beer daily
rsi32t,t5_2syer,There was a lot of meat as you can imagine
rsi32t,t5_2syer,By the end of the trip my toe was swollen and I was generally in pain
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I came back went to my doc and said he thought it was gout
rsi32t,t5_2syer,Told me to take mg of Alieve twice a day if it reoccurs
rsi32t,t5_2syer,He also sent me for a uric acid test which was 
rsi32t,t5_2syer,Fast forward one month and I haven introduced alcohol back into my life
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I am not drinking excessively but I am drinking
rsi32t,t5_2syer,Yesterday I had a bit more than usual having  bottle of wine and  tall boys
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I also ate oysters and made the most incredible octopus pasta known to man  Anyway today I feel my toe again
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I took an Advil and before I got to bed I will take  Alieves
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I fairly confident this is gout but I have also had that toe pop a couple of days ago and some very mild pain of the toe for the last week or two
rsi32t,t5_2syer,It was so mild I dont even know when it started nor did bother me
rsi32t,t5_2syer,Anyhow what should ask my doctor to confirm whether this is gout for sure or not
rsi32t,t5_2syer,The first time this happened my toe was pretty painful but not excruciating or anything like that
rsi32t,t5_2syer,but maybe because I am on 
rsi32t,t5_2syer,mg of Prednisone for life Addisons disease
rsi32t,t5_2syer,Sheets and socks did not bother it but putting my shoe was somewhat difficult although not impossible
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I want to confirm this is gout  before I start on a regime of NSAIDs that I might not need
rsi32t,t5_2syer,The other thing that perplexes is that I am not overweight like I read on here
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I am  lbs
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I probably should be  but that is not far off
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I also exercise like crazy
rsi32t,t5_2syer,This year alone I have done KM on my bike
rsi32t,t5_2syer,Why the fuck is this happening to me
rsi32t,t5_2syer,I am so down about this its insane especially when I read the Dr Edwards AMA that gout is also associated with heart disease
rsi32t,t5_2syer,high blood pressure and a poor immune system
rsi32t,t5_2syer,So based on all of this how do I confirm for sure if this is gout

ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,but I mailed him some stuff I forgot
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,  He seemed unconcerned until he tested my reflexes
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,the most notable being
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,whatever he was testing by moving my fingers down
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Along with my left leg not really giving the knee jerk or some other reaction he was looking for with my foot
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Is it common for MS patients to have poor reflexes
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,What was he testing exactly
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,He also got really concerned about some drypainful eye Id wake up with
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,only my left eye
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,along with even more concern about my right eye not being able to look all the way to the right
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,though Im almost certain this was just something I was born with
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,premature by  and half months
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Never got confirmed by my family
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,For sure had it for years now
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,  Due to this and all of my listed symptoms
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,hes suspecting MS again or some other autoimmune disease
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,and is making me do a c and t spine mri along with a spinal tap before April which Im REALLY dreading
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Please tell me itll go okay
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,the horror stories about awful headaches worries me so much
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Ive been mostly fine since later October
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Some feet pins and needlestingling every now and then
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,and muscle spasms in a couple spots
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,but once I got the bad news on Monday
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,I got worked up
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,and since then Ive started to feel a lot worse
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Can stress cause a flare up of symptomsrelapse
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Ive been getting back pains
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,lower and middle
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,and my neck
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,along with nausea and loose stool again
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,and some mild headaches
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,The tingling is still high but the numbness I was getting again thankfully seems to have already gotten better after just a couple of days
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,though the rest remains
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Comes and goes in severity
ryoqwp,t5_2s23e,Thanks for any info on things

oo9ed3,t5_2r876,THe doctor told us that if the sweat test comes negative

r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,Hydroxychloroquine and appetite Hello allI posted before about waiting to receive a diagnosis
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,and I did get confirmation about  weeks ago that I have lupus
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,I started hydroxychloroquine last week
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,Ive been told it can take months to start to work
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,so I dont expect to feel anything yet and Im doing the best to manage my symptoms in the meantime
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,My question now is
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,has anyone else found heir appetite to be reduced on it
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,He past week since I started taking it
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,I notice Im not as hungry as I normally would be and when I do get hungry
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,I am fuller faster than normal
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,Ive been eating less than normal
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,Is this typical on hydroxychloroquine
r3n1cw,t5_2rtve,Has anyone else had this happen
r068zw,t5_2rtve,Lupus and workgrad school I was diagnosed with Lupus this month and just finished up my first semester of grad school along with working FT
r068zw,t5_2rtve,I had a rough time in terms of finding balance
r068zw,t5_2rtve,and even time to exercise
r068zw,t5_2rtve,I also have another medical issue that makes me medically complex and Im reconsidering what life looks like moving forward
r068zw,t5_2rtve,Am strongly considering taking next semester off to get in the groove at work or seek a new job without the added stress of school
r068zw,t5_2rtve,I am not sure how Lupus will impact me going forward has anyone made life decisions around scaling back career or educational goals after diagnosis
r068zw,t5_2rtve,To be blunt
r068zw,t5_2rtve,I wonder if saving money for future medical issues is a better decision than taking more grad courses given the questions around health and life expectancy
onv8ey,t5_2syer,Any gout sufferers here who live alone
onv8ey,t5_2syer,Ive always thought of moving out and living by myself yet coming from a gout-sufferer POV
onv8ey,t5_2syer,it might seem like its not the best idea
onv8ey,t5_2syer,A flairup happening at its worse is prolly late niteearly in the morning and not having another person to help you would make things worse
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,Yesterday twisted my ankle
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,now it looks like gout
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,Any other people experienced this before
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,I have very flexible ankles and rarely have real impact the day after when I twist my ankle
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,I walked it off after it happened but was surprised this morning when my ankle hurt
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,So I did what I normally do
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,I bit my tongue and took the car and off I went to work
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,As the day progressed I started to doubt whether my ankle was hurting because I twisted it
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,I had no real apparent bruising nor was my ankle extra thick
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,What I had have however was a very stiff joint that even without pressure put on it
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,couldnt be moved and I constantly felt it
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,So I took my medicine and a painkiller when I got home and am curious how this will progress
pfzh9z,t5_2syer,Anyone have had similar experiences

s9m35x,t5_2s23e,so Im in limbo medically at the moment
s9m35x,t5_2s23e,Im just after a bit of reassurance that its not selfish to want to play
s9m35x,t5_2s23e,or going to cause people issues rather than give me a release
rw055p,t5_2qlaa,Fundoplication Post Surgery My fiancé had intense GERD and a hiatal hernia and elected to move forward with a fundoplication about  years ago

rw055p,t5_2qlaa,lack of appetite
rw055p,t5_2qlaa,He got a full fundoplication so he isnt able to regurgitate so the intense amount of acid reflux he has just sits in his stomach and creates what he describes as a chest filled with lava  Has anyone else thats received a fundoplication had issues or recurrent symptoms years later

rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,Hi so when my gerd gets triggered I get a lot of belching and heavy chest trapped gas
rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,My GERD has been acting up slightly for the past few days but all manageable
rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,Its just today I am getting chest discomfort that is hard to explain
rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,Its always on one area
rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,on the left side sternum rounding below or above the left breast
rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,I also get spasm on random parts of my abdomen but recently its on my left side
rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,Id get scared and think of my heart as I always do i got heart related anxiety due to gerd but then it goes away and comes back again and it makes me doubt cos sometimes when I change positions its gone
rnhjmm,t5_2qlaa,is it possible that gerd can also manifest as like a muscle or outside pain

rebhot,t5_2s1h9,Sleeping Meds and Lamitrogine Hi all
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,I obviously know I need to speak to my neurologist about this ultimately
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,but I wanted to reach out and ask you guys if anyone has any experience with taking sleeping medications and lamitrogine at the same time
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,and if there were any complicationsbad interactions
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,My main trigger is lack of sleep
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,and lately Ive been finding myself unable to sleep very often
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,I largely use marijuana to get to sleep
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,and that works
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,but we cant always have it available
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,So thats it
rebhot,t5_2s1h9,just wanted to ask for some of yalls experiences with sleeping meds
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,Rant what did i do to deserve this
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,Sorry if this isnt allowed
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,or is in the wrong place
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,  I was diagnosed this august
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,and am  infusions into 
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,In some ways this is all new and foreign territory being sick
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,I just got out of the rest room
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,- minutes ago
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,i was at the hospital
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,Bladder so full and incapable of getting a urine sample out
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,my medication requires a negative pregnancy test before every transfusion
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,A uterus my age overrides the fact i have been celibate for  months
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,A month ago
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,i spent three hours trying to urinate
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,and was at the infusion clinic for  hours
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,and the stress constricted my veins to getting the IV was arduous
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,i got horrifically lost
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,Needless to say i cant do more IVs without CBD gummies and ample lidocaine
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,My continence had long been slipping
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,but this bladder hesitancy is new
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,i get both nearly wetting myself and then being un able to pee as soon as i reach the toilet
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,At least im fortunate that urology is on my chart notes
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,A month ago i dont think they took my inability to urinate as anything more than shyness
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,the nurses were on it
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,not just letting me wait
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,and finally taking blood to test and pushed my appt put until Sunday am
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,Thanks for the weekend
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,But also thanks for telling the urine test to fuck off
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,Lets be honest
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,single  year old woman does not want this to be her life
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,She does not want MS
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,she does not want the burden of infusions
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,and she does not want the simultaneous pressure to hydrate along with an absolute terror of having an accident because you hydrated
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,Its the first symptom ive been utterly embarrassed to talk about
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,but its fundamentally wreaking havoc on my life
ryoykk,t5_2s23e,What the fuck

sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,I f have been dealing with constipation for a realllllly long time
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Ive been to  gastroenterologists who have never been able to help me with my constipation
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,and all around uncomfortable feeling in my stomach
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Ive done everything Ive been instructed to do
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,I tried Linzess for a while

sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,I eat fiber
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,yada yada you get the idea
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Ive tried drinking warm prune juice
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,but thats only made me more gassy and it causes my stomach to cramp
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Ive had to do several miralax  dulcolax cleanses
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,but they never clear me out
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,I do miralax daily
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Ive tried enemas and suppositories but they dont work

sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,The xray on the fifth day said I had sitz markers throughout the descending and sigmoid colon and that I had a large colonic stool burden
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Im so stressed out about this because I honest to god dont know what I can do
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Im so backed up and its daunting to think that I have to get all of that out lol

sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,I cant leave it like this
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,But I dont know what my gastro is going to suggest to me and Im nervous
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Ive tried so many things and nothing works
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,When I try to look things up about slow transit constipation its not helpful because most articles are aimed at parents for their kids

sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,Anyone here with slow transit constipation
sl58iq,t5_2s3g1,please let me know what youre doing or have done

smydsi,t5_2tyg2,Psychosis risk from Delta  vs delta 
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,Is delta  or  safer then delta  when it comes to psychosis or schizophrenia type things
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,When I was in the hospital and had psychosis they blamed it on me using thc vape but I also was severely depressed and in a toxic relationship
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,I also hadnt slept in  days since I was stressed from being in the hospital
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,but they still said I could NEVER risk smoking again
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,update to a little over a year from then
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,Ive been smoking the last  months on and off but most of the time daily and had no problems
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,my tolerance has been much lower since going into psychosis and I get a lot higher then I used to
smydsi,t5_2tyg2,This could be from medication interactions also though
sm2uo4,t5_2saq9,not sure where to post this but I seem to get really sick after a bowel movement
sm2uo4,t5_2saq9,I get a headache and get really shaky and the chills and it seems to last for an hour or more
sm2uo4,t5_2saq9,I know pots is something different
sm2uo4,t5_2saq9,But is this a vaso vagal response
sm2uo4,t5_2saq9,I also get nauseous too
sm2uo4,t5_2saq9,I also get really light headed and the blood rushes to my head if I stand up too fast
sm2uo4,t5_2saq9,I even noticed recently feeling nauseous when blood is on the screen of a TV show too

s2a8j4,t5_2rtve,And how did you overcome it
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I am going to the doctor tomorrow and we will be discussing if I have POTS
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I could use some reassuring words
soykp0,t5_2saq9,Im  years old and have had issues with dizziness
soykp0,t5_2saq9,etc when standing up for probably  years on and off
soykp0,t5_2saq9,Things have gotten much worse recently however and I am now at a point where getting up to go to the bathroom makes my heart pound extremely hard
soykp0,t5_2saq9,and I can never seem to catch my breath at all
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I spend my days sitting or laying down because thats all I have energy for
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I used to be a really active person
soykp0,t5_2saq9,but now I consider it a good day if was able to do the dishes
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I was given a -day event monitor last year where they found my heart rate spikes extremely high randomly throughout the day
soykp0,t5_2saq9,They ordered for me to be screened for POTS but I ended up feeling better and didnt go
soykp0,t5_2saq9,As things have gotten worse now
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I will be seeing my GP tomorrow and asking about POTS as well as possibly asthma because of how hard it is to breathe fully
soykp0,t5_2saq9,What can I expect
soykp0,t5_2saq9,Will they be able to test me there tomorrow
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I am autistic and had to arrange for an advocate to come with me to this appointment
soykp0,t5_2saq9,so Im worried theyll schedule me for some other test at a later date and Ill have a hard time getting there
soykp0,t5_2saq9,I am having a really hard time sleeping because I am so worried about this visit tomorrow
soykp0,t5_2saq9,if anyone can give me any advice or share with me what this process looked like for them it would be greatly appreciated

svm7py,t5_2s23e,Only trouble is I think those pretty turquoise pills must have lots of tiny little knives in them
svm7py,t5_2s23e,The flushing I can deal
svm7py,t5_2s23e,the nausea not fun but I can deal
svm7py,t5_2s23e,Im nearly on a full does but not yet
svm7py,t5_2s23e,Last week I was violently Ill for  hours
svm7py,t5_2s23e,Barfing but that could have been me trying to keep up while moving homes
svm7py,t5_2s23e,Anyway I feel like Im trying to pass a mace ball every time I take one
svm7py,t5_2s23e,I dont think Im constipated things are still moving but like knives
svm7py,t5_2s23e,Its very painful like crunched in a ball and cant do much
svm7py,t5_2s23e,Im reluctant to take them but IM not going to stop
svm7py,t5_2s23e,I waited till like  min after eating today and it wasnt as bad
svm7py,t5_2s23e,Tips and tricks
svm7py,t5_2s23e,I feel like digestive problems are bad but better then brain damage
s1dpnm,t5_2s23e,Is Lhermittes sign something that happens ALL the time or only once in awhile
s1dpnm,t5_2s23e,Im currently in diagnostic process with a neurologist and we have eliminated b deficiency so far
s1dpnm,t5_2s23e,But I remember him asking if I had any neck pain and then I came across Lhermittes sign and it sounds a lot like the random shocks Ive been getting over the past couple years
s1dpnm,t5_2s23e,I cant replicate it on cue though so Im wondering if should happen all the time or not
qkjcst,t5_2syer,first month on allo
qkjcst,t5_2syer,random gout attack in knee
qkjcst,t5_2syer,first month on Allo and was in wedding this weekend
qkjcst,t5_2syer,woke up monday with severe knee pain
qkjcst,t5_2syer,never had a gout flare in my knee before and man does it suck a mooses ass
qkjcst,t5_2syer,I know it will all be worth it eventually lol
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,How you ingest weed vs
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,How severe your condition is So Ive been a pretty regular user of weed for some time
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,Ive done everything from gummy edibles
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,to even having a puff of a joint a single time dont tell my physician
rgkkvk,t5_2r876, Through my experiences Ive enjoyed convection heating of bud the most basically an oven in miniature form because it offers the smoothest draw and lowest range of heat
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,But even that has been too much for my lungs given regular use
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,Ive always gone back to oils and ingestables in general
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,Now my question is Im starting Trikafta soon and am starting to re-consider my options
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,For those of you who are on Trikafta
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,does using weed interfere with your health to the point that its not worth using
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,then what is your suggestion for a once-a-week user of weed
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,Are conventional vapes
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,or convection vapes too harsh
rgkkvk,t5_2r876,Or can you tolerate them for periodic use

sjqwd5,t5_2tyg2,Help My Son started meds Rexulti  Trintellix almost  months ago and we noticed a calm about him and he wasnt dwelling on his delusional story or belief that someone was spyingstalking him and trying to ruin his life and reputation for the last month or so and seemed to be improving
sjqwd5,t5_2tyg2,All of a sudden last night he had a panic attack and started talking and obsessing and freaking out once again about it
sjqwd5,t5_2tyg2,It felt as though the last month just went right back to square one
sjqwd5,t5_2tyg2,I know he is taking his meds
sjqwd5,t5_2tyg2,Im not sure if this is something that happens or what I should do or not do
sjqwd5,t5_2tyg2,Any help or insight would be so appreciated
p4438w,t5_2syer,avoid those Shrimp Flavored Crackers I was diagnosed with gout a few years ago carefully watching my diet
p4438w,t5_2syer,I hadnt had a flare-up since early this year
p4438w,t5_2syer,Whatever you do
p4438w,t5_2syer,avoid binging on these
p4438w,t5_2syer,jpg After one or two each I was fine
p4438w,t5_2syer,but as soon as I ate my rd
p4438w,t5_2syer,I sensed a gout flare-up happening in my left knuckle
p4438w,t5_2syer,It was a few years ago that the same knuckle made my entire hand balloon up
p4438w,t5_2syer,to the point I went to the ER
s245zh,t5_2saq9,Did anyone else find it nearly impossible for there family to know what you are going through
s245zh,t5_2saq9,My Dad and wife have thought I am hypocrodic for years
s245zh,t5_2saq9,I finally get a diagnosis and they still treat me like it is all in my head
s245zh,t5_2saq9,I dont know what to do
s245zh,t5_2saq9,I feel like my life is falling apart
risogo,t5_2syer,Should I persuade my doctor to prescribe me allopurinolrefer me to a rheumatologist with a normal uric acid level
risogo,t5_2syer,I was diagnosed with gout mid-August
risogo,t5_2syer,I have no idea how I got it I work out at least  times a week eat a healthy diet primarily composed of chicken breast
risogo,t5_2syer,and vegetables hardly ever eat beef or seafood drink hard liquor straight -x a month and lack a family history
risogo,t5_2syer,The episode was debilitating and took me about  weeks to fully recover
risogo,t5_2syer,A combination of the pain and restriction to my range of movement kept me nearly bed bound for those at least 
risogo,t5_2syer, weeks and greatly interfered with my quality of life for the rest of time
risogo,t5_2syer,I saw my doctor who prescribed me indocin which helped a lot but gave me the worst stomach problems even when I took my omeprazole beforehand
risogo,t5_2syer,I would often wake up in the middle of the night from the pain and be forced to eat something
risogo,t5_2syer,Wanting never to go through this pain in my life
risogo,t5_2syer,I talked to my doctor about putting me on allopurinol but my labs just made it into the normal range for uric acid after weeks of me drinking gallons of water and eating only porridge and vegetables
risogo,t5_2syer,This morning I started to feel a flare coming on and took my indocin which is helping
risogo,t5_2syer,albeit I dont know if its merely treating my symptoms
risogo,t5_2syer,Im glad my classes are over for the semester
risogo,t5_2syer,but Id rather not go through pain and immobilization of a gout episode and indocin side effects
risogo,t5_2syer,Should I pressure my doctor to refer me to a rheumatologist or straight up prescribe me allopurinol

plquvh,t5_2syer,No flare ups since starting in April
plquvh,t5_2syer,Been suffering with gout and high uric acid for the last  years
plquvh,t5_2syer,Tried all the remedies
plquvh,t5_2syer,more water but i had some bad flare ups - a year and few minor ones between those
plquvh,t5_2syer,Then it started moving from my toes
plquvh,t5_2syer,ankles and even elbow
plquvh,t5_2syer,So I finally went to a rheumatologist and got officially diagnosed

plquvh,t5_2syer,But I also maintain other things like staying hydrated
plquvh,t5_2syer,avoid too much beer
plquvh,t5_2syer,I hope I keep going with no flare ups
plquvh,t5_2syer,Most of the things I read about allo on Reddit and online have been really hopeful

plquvh,t5_2syer,Edit Also message me if you want to hear about the process of getting diagnosed and I can give you my experience

pv7mho,t5_2syer,Home made chicken soup and gout
pv7mho,t5_2syer,Not sure you guys know but you cook the chicken carcass

rkil16,t5_2syer,Generally speaking I think we have a pretty good community here personal preferencesdiscrepancies aside allo is great
rkil16,t5_2syer,as are tart cherry supplements   Anyway
rkil16,t5_2syer,just an idea
rkil16,t5_2syer,perhaps we can use our often dehabilitating pain to make some contactsnetwork
rkil16,t5_2syer,Im a graphic designer myself
rkil16,t5_2syer,how about you
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Barretts people what PPIs have worked for youWhat else have you tried thats helped with side effects
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Hi all Im  and have had a Barretts diagnosis now since May this year
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,but have been diagnosed with hiatus hernia for about  years now
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Ive found cutting down on lactose does also help me a bit but obviously
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,there are other issues
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,and there is now damage that needs to be managed
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,I have done the rounds of Lansaprosole
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Esomeprosole and Pantaprosole and they do definitely help with reflux
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Im currently on mg esomeprozole mg x a day but I get a lot of side effects like  Farting
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,So much farting
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,And really nasty ones too
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Sleep has not been great in fact its been worse since I came off coffee strangely but I hear this can also be a side effect
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,When I do sleep
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Im still really tired in the mornings I can function
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,but its noticeable
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,Good old Folic acid deficiency
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,For us lot with Barretts
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,PPIs for life is the treatment plan
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,I wondered if either youd found any other PPIs that had less side effects
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,or if there were any other treaments you had tried that had been effective
rfdn7d,t5_2qlaa,My consultant was recommending Stretta if my body really cant tolerate PPIs but we probably need to prove that is definitely not the case first
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,More information regarding POTS Hey guys Im new to all of this and believe I may be experiencing symptoms from POTS
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,Curious if you guys can help provide some more information so I can dial it down as my doctors are having trouble narrowing down
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,At first I was having weird symptoms of feeling light headedness out of no where with brain fog and a feeling I might faint
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,Shortly after Id catch a weird feeling in my body followed by anxiety
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,Went to the doctor and they ran blood
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,and usual checkup and couldnt find anything
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,I was thinking maybe Im diabetic or Im lacking iron or something along these lines
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,All he stated was he thinks I may be dehydrated but Im drinking about  gallon of water a day
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,The final symptoms which Im not sure is even relevant is as Im falling asleep
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,I have a panic attack
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,Whatever reason I think Im dying and this is it and Im fighting to wake myself up
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,What stuck out to me was at my first doctors visit he took my blood pressure and bpm while I was laying down
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,and then standing up
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,He just made a weird comment that all these increased alot faster than is normal
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,I fought myself awake one night and I was googling all these symptoms and stumbled on POTS
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,Also how long Covid may cause POTS as all these symptoms started a month after I had the Delta variant
sw1j6z,t5_2saq9,Any help would be appreciated as Im getting exhausted dealing with these symptoms

so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Really need some advice about what to do with a parent with deillusions My SOs mom is losing it
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,She thinks everyone is out to get her
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,They all have access to her house
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,her phone has been hacked
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,She changes phones twice a year or so
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,From what I was told
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,this happened for several weeks once or twice while SO was younger but then it got better
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Then about a year ago it came back
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,She really has paranoid delusions
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Shell forget to eat and check her bank about obsessively many many times a day to make sure the hackers didnt take any money
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,So far psychs havent been helpful imo
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,They are giving her clonazapine and Wellburtin
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,To make matters worse
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,my SOs mom lives in China were in US
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,She was visiting here and got stuck here during the pandemic
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Started to get paranoid about being hacked
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,We thought the social isolation and lack of friends was making things worse
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,And she was still mostly fine
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,So we sent her back thinking a familiar environment and being able to communicate would help
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,But it seems shes taken a turn for the worst
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,She wont answer her phone and no one has heard from her
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Last we heard from her sister she came over crying and called the police saying they are trying to get her
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Im just looking for advice on what to do
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,I dont know much but it seems she should on antipsychotics
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,what else can be done
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,We regret sending her back but she had to eventually because her visa was overstayed and only granted exception because of the pandemic
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Thank you in advance
so6vno,t5_2tyg2,Im trying my best to comfort my SO but this is incredibly hard dealing with this from the other side of the planet
rymj06,t5_2s23e,Covid right before Ocrevusrituxan infusion
rymj06,t5_2s23e,Has anyone had Covid right before their infusion
rymj06,t5_2s23e,I possibly have the worlds mildest omicron case or I just have a mild headache and mild sore throat
rymj06,t5_2s23e,Two negative rapids
rymj06,t5_2s23e,I went for a PCR today
rymj06,t5_2s23e,My infusion is scheduled for Jan 
rymj06,t5_2s23e,Has anyone been given any specific advice about delaying an infusion due to COVID assuming you were feeling better by the infusion
rymj06,t5_2s23e,I should get PCR results tomorrow and would obviously reach out to the doctor if its positive
rymj06,t5_2s23e,Im mostly just curious if theres a standard protocol
si4lz1,t5_2tyg2,Is this normal or was I lied to
si4lz1,t5_2tyg2,I was talking to a friend today about how when I was majorly depressed I had a delusion and accompanying hallucinations of being trapped in a matrix-like dimension that I needed to break out of through suicideshattering the dimension wall or regaining control of my real body
si4lz1,t5_2tyg2,They told me that when I saw the shatteringglitches of my reality essentially had hallucinations of a shattering which caused the glitch effect behind the glass it was normal and everyone else had it and essentially that Im just trying to be different
si4lz1,t5_2tyg2,I said shes lying and she said she isnt and named people who supposedly had it and then mocked me for trying to be different by imitating me crying about being the same as everyone else
si4lz1,t5_2tyg2,Is it actually really common
si4lz1,t5_2tyg2,This was a big thing for me at the time and I feel kinda sad about being mocked so can anyone confirm if Im actually just trying to be different and special
si4lz1,t5_2tyg2,Honest blunt truth please
s3hu9t,t5_2saq9,Pre-Syncope Hi f recently diagnosed  Does anyone get on the verge of passing out but your heart rate is only bpm
s3hu9t,t5_2saq9,I know that is still high but is it really high enough to cause you to faint
s3hu9t,t5_2saq9,I just had an episode dizzy
s3hu9t,t5_2saq9,super hot and sweaty out of nowhere that caused me to nearly faint but thankfully I laid down in time and things went back to normal nearly immediately but I feel as though my heart rate isnt high enough to cause that
shs4zu,t5_2syer,I started on allo  months or so ago
shs4zu,t5_2syer,In that time I made some pretty drastic lifestyle changes
shs4zu,t5_2syer,lost a load of weight and cut out beer from my life
shs4zu,t5_2syer,Then I had my UA checked and it was in the normal range
shs4zu,t5_2syer,I decided to wean off the allo to see if I could handle gout naturally
shs4zu,t5_2syer,Just had my UA rechecked and it is again high  umolL
shs4zu,t5_2syer,Reconsidering getting back on the allo
shs4zu,t5_2syer,My question is last time I started on allo it led to the worst flair up ive had
shs4zu,t5_2syer,I really dont want that again
shs4zu,t5_2syer,Has anyone experimented with gradually introducing allo to avoid a flair up
shs4zu,t5_2syer,e gradually building up to taking a daily dose over a few weeks or so
shs4zu,t5_2syer,Is it even a thing
shs4zu,t5_2syer,obvs I need to speak to my doctor about this
shs4zu,t5_2syer,but just looking to see if anyone has tried this before
suj6bs,t5_2syer,Prednisone or indomethacin which is safer for high blood pressure
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,Those with Acid Reflux What do you consume on a daily basis
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,Im currently on  mg pantaprozole  tablet daily every morning  mins before meals
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,It seems to be helping with my acid reflux and i dont get heartburns anymore
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,i am scared to trigger my acid reflux
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,Would just like to check what are the things that you guys consume on a daily basis to not trigger your acid reflux
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,Do you guys completely stay away from coffee
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,Is occasional alcohol allowed in a moderate amount during social events
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,What kind of daily food do you guys consume
rhrb9p,t5_2qlaa,im in Singapore
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,PPI withdrawal heart side effects
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,Ive been dealing with reflux and gastritis since June of  so I started taking omeprazole which screwed up my stomach BIG TIME and Im convinced is actually what ruined my body instead of my minor nighttime reflux I started taking it for
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,After months of dealing with that I tried dropping it for something else
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,but I started getting major heart palpitations and would wake up with my heart racing like -bpm
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,It would keep happening throughout the day but all my doctors said it was anxiety since Ive had issues with that most of my life but I know my body well enough to know the difference
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,I hopped onto mg pantoprazole and some daily anxiety meds from a psychiatrist which seemed to make the heart stuff go away at first and my stomach improved just from getting off the omeprazole
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,but I still havent been able to really eat and the correct foods are still bothering me
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,Long story short
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,Ive messed with my panto doses like  times and each time after a few days of either pausing it or cutting it in half Ive had all the heart stuff come back
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,even with me still taking my anxiety meds
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,I did have a lot of testing done last year from my cardio granted everything I did came after I got the meds so my heart had calmed down which all came back normal
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,but when I ask my doctors about these side effects from stopping PPIs they all just kinda look at me
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,and say Im a weird case and its anxiety
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,Ive got a new GI doc who seems nicer and wants to get me off them onto some famotidine
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,but in the process of weaning off getting there to try that Im back to the same square of a constant racing heart and palpitations
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,Its been almost two weeks now and the only thing kinda keeping them in check is me taking my emergency panic attack meds
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,Ive read stories about people having this kind of stuff happen WHILE theyre taking it
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,but has anyone had any bad side effects getting off them like this
rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,I kinda just need to know Im not alone since my other doctors all point at each other in a circle and say ask that one
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,First cardio appointment this afternoon
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,I am going to a cardiologist this afternoon for the first time
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,after my primary care doc referred me for POTS-like symptoms
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,My sister has POTS
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,which I feel like ups the possibility of me also having it
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,I also am waiting for referrals for suspected Ehlers Danlos
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,Im so nervous about this appointment
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,worried that theyll say everything is totally fine when I know something is wrong
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,Would it be too self diagnose-ish or hypochondriac-like to print the list of POTS symptoms and highlight the ones I experience
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,so I dont forget to mention anything
st7oe8,t5_2saq9,My brain fog along with my nerves is bound to make me forget or lose my train of thought
st6w2p,t5_2saq9,have to take prednisone today for a pre-medication protocol
st6w2p,t5_2saq9,i just passed out from sneezing lol
s8tzqt,t5_2tyg2,on PsychologyToday you can search for therapists specializing in video game addiciton and sports performance but when it comes to psychosissz its go fuck yourself
swnwsd,t5_2s3g1,Researchers Identify Bacteria That Underlie Success of Fecal Microbiota Transplants
s5x7f9,t5_2tyg2,Tell me about your hallucinations especially visual Im working on a comic involving a group of psychotic people living together and caring for each other
s5x7f9,t5_2tyg2,and their perceptions interact with each other
s5x7f9,t5_2tyg2,This would work best with visual hallucinations although I do want to include other aspects of psychosis
s5x7f9,t5_2tyg2,still figuring out how
s5x7f9,t5_2tyg2,My experience is limiting Ive seen bugs

snlo2n,t5_2rtve,My Nemesis We Meet Again Hello to all
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,Full disclosure I have mixed connective tissue disease rather than Lupus
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,but they are sister conditions due to symptom overlap
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,I also have fibro and dystonia
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,a neurological movement disorder
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,I have bronchitis following a likely case of covid long covid
snlo2n,t5_2rtve, and my doc started me on high dose prednisone today
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,Am I the only one who dreads having to take prednisone
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,I understand its necessary for me to kick infections and downplay my immune system during severe flares but man
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,how I hate it
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,I get the flushing like Im on fire from within
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,starving all the time but too weak to do any sort of cooking
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,I bruise if you even LOOK at me too hard
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,fluid retention like a mother
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,and it exacerbates my tremors from my neurological motor dysfunction
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,I just absolutely hate it
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,On the bright side
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,my MCTD flares are far in between and often so mild I can get by without having to take prednisone
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,so I usually only take it when I have a respiratory infection
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,since covid masking
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,happens much more rarely than it used to
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,But I do dread the day that the MCTD gets more severe
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,resulting in needing prednisone on the regular
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,Am I the only one who gets such awful prednisone side effects
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,Id like to know Im not alone in this
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,Thank you for reading
snlo2n,t5_2rtve,Hope you are all doing as well as possible with your medical issues
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,Is Xifaxan worth a try for IBS-D
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,Its probably the only thing I havent tried yet
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,My GI doc wants me to give it a try
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,but even he admits that the best you can hope for is a few weeks or a month of improvement
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,He says if it works he can prescribe it up to x per year
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,But Im not sure if its worth bothering with
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,I dont really like taking unecessary chances with antibiotics further screwing up my micro-flora
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,or dealing with possible side effects for no good reason
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,So Im wonding what other people think
sn7cg4,t5_2s3g1,Even if its helpful is it owrth the botherrisk given the short-term results at best

rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I really hate what Epilepsy has done to me
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,It has ruined me
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Im  and was diagnosed when I was 
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Probably had it my whole life since I had plenty of problems with passing out
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Its considered mild Epilepsy and I can go years without one
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,When they do happen though
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I bloody my face up
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I break my arm in multiple places
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I get concussions
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,lose weeks of memory
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,The last seizure was two years ago and I ended up the last two examples along with pulling every muscle in both arms
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,No seizures since then
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,but now I suffer from migraines
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,and a deep well of depression
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I cant think straight
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,A migraine hits and I lose focus of whatever I was doing
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I still cant remember what happened the two weeks after the seizure
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,My arms are still in pain and my hands even in pain
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,The only thing Im good at is art and it hurts so much when I do try to draw
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I havent drawn anything in three months because I was tearing up from the pain
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I left the factory I was working at when it happened because it made the migraines and pain worse
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,And I was such a hard worker
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,A good worker
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Also I was treated differently
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,which if this was school
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I would be the special kid
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Ive always been treated differently
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Like I was a plague
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,I could keep going but another migraine is hitting me and I must lay down
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Let me get to the point thanks to Epilepsy
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,my life has been complete shit
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,It has caused lasting damage to me physically and mentally
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Theres plenty of days I wish to go to sleep one night and not wake up
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,If there was a God
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Id go right up and strangle him
rlcnsp,t5_2s1h9,Im so tired of all of it
sf8ov5,t5_2saq9,Loss of taste and smell during migraine I had a pretty terrible migraine last week and I noticed that before and during the attack I lost my sense of taste and smell
sf8ov5,t5_2saq9,I reached out to my neurologist
sf8ov5,t5_2saq9,and she said this is not typical of migraines
sf8ov5,t5_2saq9,I do have diagnosed POTS
sf8ov5,t5_2saq9,Just curious if anyone else has experienced this before
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,HSCT Update  Months Out TLDR Mexico HSCT  months post MRI stable
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,Promoted at work
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,Need many years to know if it worked as well as I hope
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,I thought Id give another update on my experience so far after my most recent appointment
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,The treatment itself hasnt led to any real side effects that I have noticed
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,My cell counts were low for the first  months or so as expected
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,but since  months post I am no longer immunocompromised
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,Had an asymptomatic viral reactivation that didnt require treatment and dipped back into neutropenia for a period
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,but I had no symptoms
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,it hasnt been a total magic bullet
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,I still get tingles or numbness here and there sometimes
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,and maybe Im a bit fatigued but thats hard to measure
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,The lesions are all still there
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,with maybe a bit of improvement on a few
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,my MRIs are stable so far and Im hopeful they may continue to be
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,I asked my doc and he agreed Ocrevus would have likely done the same thing but that my gamble with HSCT appears to be paying off so far
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,My reasoning with HSCT is for  year brain volume loss prevention and to avoid ongoing immunosuppression
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,So that will take a lot of time to get a final verdict
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,At work Ive been promoted and I hope this treatment will help me use my brain for many years
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,Vit D k  day
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,a B complex
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,and Omegas for supplements though I have no way of really knowing if they are helping
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,I eat mostly pescatarian and have kept active with runningwalking a bunch
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,As always feel free to ask questions here or PM
s2oac1,t5_2s23e,Im not a doctor but I do have opinions that may or may not be correct   Hope everyone is doing ok amidst everything going on

rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,A request for some emotional supportadvice
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Happy to give some back
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Im a  year old girl
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Ive had temporal lobe epilepsy for about 
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,and have an average of  seizures a month or so I thought
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Ive been on  different medications Sodium Valproate
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Briviact and all of them havent slowed or stopped my seizures
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Over the years its gotten worse and worse
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,starting off with simple partial
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,then complex partial
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,now generalised epilepsy
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,My neurologist didnt believe me
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,He said that he believed all of them were psychological seizures or pseudo seizures
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,He didnt believe me because when doing EEGs in a doctors office I was never able to set off a seizure
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,three months ago I decided to do an at home  day video EEG
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Turns out Im having about  seizures a week
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9, of them in my sleep
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9, during the day
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,I just never remember the ones during the day because I live alone
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,My neurologist didnt take the news well
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Im sure because it was a hit to his ego
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,But here I am now
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,I dont know how to take this news
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Im trying to look on the bright side
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,at least I know whats going on now
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,but its hard
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,I just dont know what to think
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,Ever since hearing the results Ive spiralled into a depression and am anxious of how much damage this has been doing to my brain over the past 
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,this was partly me getting everything off my chest
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,but mainly a request for some advice
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,How do you deal with results
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,How do you cope with the depression after a seizure
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,How do you cope with memory issues
rlqeno,t5_2s1h9,I love this community and all of you guys
sihyqe,t5_2rtve,So Ive had Reoccurring staph acne for around  months and my auto immune symptoms all started at the same time I started getting staph
sihyqe,t5_2rtve,If I treat the staph infection could it cure lupus if I have it
sihyqe,t5_2rtve,Because I read that repeated exposure to staphylococcus  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA is associated with lupus
qgnfim,t5_2syer,My Gout Story When I was a senior in high school
qgnfim,t5_2syer,I started getting this pain in my big toe and it was very odd
qgnfim,t5_2syer,Thought it was an overused tendon or something so I ignored it
qgnfim,t5_2syer,Time when on and the pain came stronger and longer every time
qgnfim,t5_2syer,This went on for over  years
qgnfim,t5_2syer,People told me it was gout but I always thought that was something old people got
qgnfim,t5_2syer,Finally back in February of 
qgnfim,t5_2syer,I had a flare up so incredibly bad
qgnfim,t5_2syer,I went to the ER and didnt sleep for  hours
qgnfim,t5_2syer,I essentially vowed to myself screaming in pain that whatever it was
qgnfim,t5_2syer,after that day
qgnfim,t5_2syer,I would never have it again
qgnfim,t5_2syer,They sent me to sports medicine and the guy just knew it was gout from how I was describing it which most Doctors never could put together
qgnfim,t5_2syer,I went to my doctor and got a uric acid test
qgnfim,t5_2syer,it was between -
qgnfim,t5_2syer,Got on Allopurinol and not a flair up since
qgnfim,t5_2syer,  Moral of the story If you think you have gout
qgnfim,t5_2syer,go get tested
qgnfim,t5_2syer,Dont wait  years in pain like I did

ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,At work earlier tonight I was going about a normal evening when my auras hit and my brain went sideways
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,I vaguely remember grabbing the edge of the counter and holding myself up poorly
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,Then a co worker helping guide me safely to the floor while I groaned gibberish
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,One of my friends grabbed my phone and called my wife
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,They called EMS
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,By the time EMS showed I had returned to a semi lucid state and was able to answer questions but I wouldnt let them load me up and take me to the ER
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,My wife arrived a couple minutes later and between my wife and coworkers they were able to get me into the car and home
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,Upon arriving home I discovered two issues
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,The most mortifying was that I had shit my pants
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,Its only happened once before
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,I just threw my pants away
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,The second issue was that the Nausea that normally would be mild went big and I started projectile vomiting
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,My Neuro recently decreased my dose of Lamotrigine and prescribed me Aptiom
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,Because my meds are being altered
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,I knew this was a possibility
ri9d6i,t5_2s1h9,But knowing it could happen doesnt make it any less annoying when it does

rdj6e1,t5_2syer,Gout is so damn frustrating Im almost always an optimist
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,But not today
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,Does anybody in this group automatically go to the worst possible outcome when it comes to gout
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,Say youre a normal college student and eatdrink like crap and one day
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,BOOM your life changes forever because you have gout
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,I get two flare ups a year
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,am fairly healthy
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,and only  YO
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,Im  and 
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,But every attack gets worse and Ive done a good job for the last   months of changing my diet and eating less
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,Ive lost  pounds since then and was feeling a little better physically
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,Then I go to the podiatrist today and tell him that my last UA test was a 
rdj6e1,t5_2syer, and his eyeballs just about jumped out of his skull
rdj6e1,t5_2syer,He then proceeds to tell me about the possibility of long term damage -

rl2jwy,t5_2qlaa,Gerd I want to share my story   So I went in for heartburn last year and I found out I had h pylori
rl2jwy,t5_2qlaa,Then doctor gave me antibiotics with omeprazole twice a day  ever since omeprazole my life changed upside down
rl2jwy,t5_2qlaa,Anxiety to a point where I thought I had heart and brain problems  Depression  Heart palpitations  Fatigue  Brain fog  Numbness  Benching

rl2jwy,t5_2qlaa,Search omeprazole on google  of the reviews had the same symtoms as me and I thought I was going crazy
rl2jwy,t5_2qlaa,I recommend you guys researching PPIS before really taking them  never again omeprazole
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Shows EBV May Trigger MS For decades
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,researchers have suspected that people infected with an exceedingly common virus
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,might be more likely to develop multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,a neurological illness that affects a million people in the United States
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,a team of researchers reports what some say is the most compelling evidence yet of a strong link between the two diseases
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,The virus infects nearly everyone in their teen or young adult years
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,and very few go on to develop multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,The researchers also note that it is not the only known risk factor for people who develop the illness
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,But they say their data points to it being the clearest of them all
s3d99l,t5_2s23e, While it remains to be seen whether the finding will result in treatments or cures for multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,the study may further motivate research into therapies and vaccines for the condition
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,published Thursday in Science
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,the group examined data from  million people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces over two decades
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,The strength of their study
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,said its principal investigator
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,an epidemiologist at the Harvard T
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Chan School of Public Health
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,is that they were able to follow people for years and ask whether infections with Epstein-Barr preceded multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Among the service members in the study
s3d99l,t5_2s23e, developed multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,At the same time
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,the virus in question
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,infecting nearly everyone in the population at some point
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Although few are aware that they were infected
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,some develop mononucleosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,The virus remains in the body for life
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Because so few who are infected with the virus get multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,it cannot be the sole cause of the disease
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Other risk factors have been identified
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,like low levels of vitamin D and smoking
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,that were seen previously by the Harvard group using the same data set
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,There also are genetic factors   abnormal genes have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,a multiple sclerosis expert at the University of Chicago
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,who was not involved in the new study
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Gender also plays a role most patients are women
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,no risk factor stands out like Epstein-Barr infections
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,  To ask how much the virus increases risk
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,the investigators studied the small proportion of people who were not infected with the virus early in their service careers but subsequently became infected
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,They detected infections by the presence of antibodies to the virus
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,  Among the multiple sclerosis patients
s3d99l,t5_2s23e, out of  got infected with Epstein-Barr before they developed M
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,  As a control group for their study
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,the scientists tracked  individuals who were not initially infected with Epstein-Barr and who also did not get multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,just  subsequently became infected with Epstein-Barr
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,That meant an Epstein-Barr virus infection increased the risk of multiple sclerosis over thirtyfold
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Reder cautioned that it could be hard to tease out cause and effect from an epidemiological study
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,People who develop multiple sclerosis have overactive immune systems that make them develop high levels of antibodies to viral infections
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Multiple sclerosis might arise not because of the virus but because of the bodys response to it
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Multiple sclerosis patients have fewer viral infections than normal
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,because their immune systems are so active that they effectively fight off viruses
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Multiple sclerosis patients often say
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,I never get a cold
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,When I hear that
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,my ears perk up
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,anti-viral drugs have not helped patients with multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,The Harvard group tried to control for the possibility that the immune systems response
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,not the virus itself
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,increases the risk of multiple sclerosis in those infected with Epstein-Barr
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,They asked if antibodies to another common virus
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,also were linked to a greater risk of multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,They were not
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,for unknown reasons
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,seems to protect against multiple sclerosis
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,So the fact that those infected with it did not have a higher risk of multiple sclerosis might not be surprising
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Others said the study was convincing evidence of cause and effect
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,The way it was done is quite compelling
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Michael Davin Kornberg
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,a multiple sclerosis specialist at Johns Hopkins
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,It really is the most convincing data weve had for a causal association
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,a multiple sclerosis researcher at the University of California
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,noted that it might be difficult to treat multiple sclerosis by going after Epstein-Barr because it can be difficult to find the actual virus in patients
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Even though multiple sclerosis is a disease of the brain and spinal cord
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,he could not find the virus in patients spinal fluid
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,But patients do seem to harbor cells in their brains that produce antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Cree is researching whether he can treat multiple sclerosis patients by eradicating those cells
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,which are infected with Epstein-Barr
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,a multiple sclerosis researcher at Stanford
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,who wrote a perspective accompanying the Harvard groups paper
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,said an experimental mRNA vaccine against Epstein-Barr was one of a number of approaches being designed to stop the virus from affecting the brain
s3d99l,t5_2s23e,Can we make multiple sclerosis go away
sooebw,t5_2rtve,I found out I have lupus and my main concern is weight gain
sooebw,t5_2rtve,If I gain weight it will ruin my mental health especially since it my biggest insecurity and I finically got to weight and appetite where I eat but Im happy when Im full

suzgx7,t5_2s3g1,Has anyone elses IBS changed over time
p43z5i,t5_2syer, in  months
p43z5i,t5_2syer,and maybe Wet cupping
p43z5i,t5_2syer,Im pretty sure Ive had gout for yearsas recently years worth of problem joints are basically gone
p43z5i,t5_2syer,and  months ago I got tested and confirmed with a Uric Acid level over 
p43z5i,t5_2syer,The doctor Didnt want to prescribe me meds and said just ending alcohol consumption at first
p43z5i,t5_2syer,This seemed silly and I investigated and overhauled my diet completely
p43z5i,t5_2syer,The following changes dropped me from a  to an 
p43z5i,t5_2syer, over a  week period
p43z5i,t5_2syer, grams meat daily max
p43z5i,t5_2syer,none of it ever pork
p43z5i,t5_2syer,normally steak or salmon
p43z5i,t5_2syer,My non water beverages became tea and coffee onlymy youtube channel  has quite a few of these
p43z5i,t5_2syer,the latest is a burdock and grape based drink to get urine flowing in conjunction with Allo   httpswww
p43z5i,t5_2syer,v=LbfCpksIw   A lot of eggs for protein
p43z5i,t5_2syer,A lot of yogurt added to my diet
p43z5i,t5_2syer,No Alcohol
p43z5i,t5_2syer,No Meat broth soupsbone broth is okay
p43z5i,t5_2syer,No Fast Food
p43z5i,t5_2syer,When this didnt get me as low as I wanted I found a new doctor and showed him my records and diet
p43z5i,t5_2syer,HE finally prescribed me  mg allo daily
p43z5i,t5_2syer,I saw someone on here mention donating blood
p43z5i,t5_2syer,the concept being that the blood letting would take the acid in the blood out
p43z5i,t5_2syer,and your body generates new non uric blood
p43z5i,t5_2syer,I decided to try
p43z5i,t5_2syer,but instead with wet cupping
p43z5i,t5_2syer,as this can draw crystals out of your muscle
p43z5i,t5_2syer,and fat tissuestheoretically as well
p43z5i,t5_2syer,After  weeks of wet cupping  days a week
p43z5i,t5_2syer,and daily medication my score is now a 
p43z5i,t5_2syer,I thought this wouldnt happen so quickly and thought I was facing a multiple year struggle
p43z5i,t5_2syer,Im not sure to what extent each of these factors helped
p43z5i,t5_2syer,so I am going to do  weeks of no cupping
p43z5i,t5_2syer,keep diet and allo intake the same and see the results
p43z5i,t5_2syer,I hope some of this can help others
p43z5i,t5_2syer,and I highly recommend people be proactive in treating their gout with medicine  diet lifestyle
p43z5i,t5_2syer,Feedback and suggestions of the non Pharmaworshipping variety welcome

p4c3to,t5_2r876,Not huge clumps but i can see  Dr noticed my hair is thinning
p4c3to,t5_2r876,And when Dr looked into it he said its probably related to Trikafta or maybe my anxiety stress that is caused by Trikafta

svt67b,t5_2s3g1,Finally found something that seems like its working
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,After years of daily pain and several hospital trips
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,years of trying tons of medications
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,tons of tests
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,I have finally found something that works
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,fingers crossed it stays this way
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,I have two GI doctors and a therapist that Im seeing and they are all wonderful
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,Im currently taking Lexapro daily which is the real savior it seems
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,and also Linzess just to regulate my bowel movements
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,Its been about  months and I havent had too many problems
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,Still very rare flare ups which do get really bad
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,and some discomfort here and there
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,But from where I was at just a few months before
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,this is a major improvement and Im so excited to be able to do things again
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,Thanks to everyone who helped me out on this subreddit
svt67b,t5_2s3g1,I know my IBS story isnt over yet probably but Im getting there

rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,I was prescribed mg of pantroprazole once a day
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Took it for a week and half amd decide to give it up as I was feeling like my symptoms were getting worse
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa, weeks after my symptoms seemed to clear up for the most part
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Decided to enjoy a couple beers a few days while on Vacation and experienced no reflux or pain
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,A couple more weeks go by and I wake up with a stabbingcramping pain in my left middlelower abdomen
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Doesnt last long  Now from this day on everytime i eat
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,about  hours later i start getting insanely thirsty
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,lots of mucus forming in back of throat
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,and get some gnarly stomach discomfort for quite a while
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Water doesnt help the thrist and causes immediate reflux
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Lost even more weight despite eating  and lbs
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,I also Occasionally will get that stabbing or cramping pain in midlower abdomen
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,I thought the reflux was annoying but now this is just concerning
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,The thing is
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,In September before these new symptoms popped up i had a HIDA scan
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,and ultra sounds and everything looked perfect
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Doctor said I should eat whatever I want
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,go figure
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Has anyone else experienced these symptoms with their GERD or any other condition
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Or did yours start after PPIs
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Its driving me crazy and the weight loss is starting to get to me
rhj8hn,t5_2qlaa,Your comments are appreciated
pma6s4,t5_2r876,Happy to be in the group
pma6s4,t5_2r876,Im always interested to hear about other peoples experiences with CF
pma6s4,t5_2r876,so I thought I would introduce myself and share a bit about my own experiences
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I sheher am 
pma6s4,t5_2r876,born and raised in Canada
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I was diagnosed at  years old
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and Im the first and so far only person in my extended family who has CF
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I have one copy of FDel
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and another more rare one RT
pma6s4,t5_2r876,My main CF challenge is with MRSA in my lungs
pma6s4,t5_2r876,which flares up about every - months
pma6s4,t5_2r876,Ive mostly been able to manage it with oral antibiotics
pma6s4,t5_2r876,which has been nice
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I use a PEP mask in combination with salbutamol and advair puffers
pma6s4,t5_2r876,as well as hypertonic saline and pulmozyme
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I use a Philips InnoSpire Go to nebulize my meds
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and I absolutely love it
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I also take the usual enzymes
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and Im on azithromycin  times per week
pma6s4,t5_2r876,My PFTs are usually around - when healthy
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and - during an exacerbation
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I had pseudomonas as a teenager
pma6s4,t5_2r876,but we were pretty aggressive with treating it
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and suddenly in my early twenties
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I just stopped growing it
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I feel pretty lucky about that
pma6s4,t5_2r876,Ive had sinus surgery
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and some pseudomonas did show up in the culture from that surgery
pma6s4,t5_2r876,but it seems to be contained to my sinuses
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I have been married for  years
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and this year my husband and I welcomed our little daughter into the world
pma6s4,t5_2r876,She is  months old now
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and having her has been the most incredible gift of my life
pma6s4,t5_2r876,My pregnancy actually went quite smoothly
pma6s4,t5_2r876,which was also such a gift
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I did have gestational diabetes
pma6s4,t5_2r876,but was able to manage it with insulin and diet
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I have a Bachelors degree in Elementary Education
pma6s4,t5_2r876,but CF prevents me from working full-time in schools aka germ factories
pma6s4,t5_2r876,so I work for a non-profit literacy organization
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I coordinate our childrens programs
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and I love it
pma6s4,t5_2r876,Im able to work from home
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and its not too many hours
pma6s4,t5_2r876,so it works well for me
pma6s4,t5_2r876,I am also on Disability
pma6s4,t5_2r876,which has informed my stance that Universal Basic Income would be an incredibly positive thing for society
pma6s4,t5_2r876,Im on the CF Patient Advisory Committee for my clinic
pma6s4,t5_2r876,and Im always open to talking about all things CF
pma6s4,t5_2r876,so I hope to hear from some of you here

s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,can you help me
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,Im finally here on this sub after bothering all the other ones I could think of
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,took medicationones that could upset the lining of your stomach and since then
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,even tho it was only ten days
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,Ive had mild constipationsorry TMI and what my doctor says is GERD
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,He says I must try taking Omeoprozol for  weeks
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,I was taking this same time as the meds to try avoid this
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,My whole family basically takes Omeoprozol or lanzoprozol permanently and I always wished I could avoid that
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,They dont hate it but
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,Anyone appreciate Omeoprozol personally
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,Other options before I start
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,I feel like this may be a slippery slope to forever taking it
s2c7gu,t5_2qlaa,I dont feel like I can be in this low key burning chest pain on and off  anymore tho so I guess I must try what the GP says
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,TW Potential Substance Abuse or Psychotic Episode Questions for and about Meth Usingusers vs
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,TLDR does meth smell pungent
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Could you smell it if someone smokes in their room
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Is it possible to hold very small conversation on a low dose
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Do meth smokers accuse people of smoking meth
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,When backed into a corner
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,so my long term friend and roommate for the past two years and I have recently had to find a third roommate
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,We found one and thought it was going to be an easy  month lease
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,He lived with us for  days
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,just up and moved out with  absurd accusations on his way out
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,We had posted an ad about needing a new roommate as our current one was moving out no bad blood
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,they were fantastic
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,just wanted to move back home
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,In the ad
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,we had listed  friendly
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Received a message of interest from this guy who said hed like to come view the place
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,The guy shows up visibly very nervous
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,barely any talking
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,We just assumed he was nervous
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,my friend and I were very clear that she smokes a lot of weed and occasionally in the house
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,but if that was a problem
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,she would totally do it outside
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,The guy said that was totally fine and was actually looking for a place as such
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,He was definitely hitting what looked like a dab pen
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,My friend then asked if he wanted a bong rip or two and he said he was game
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,We then asked if he wanted to play some Mario kart to ease up the vibe
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,He then said
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Im pretty fucking high
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,We like reassure him dude
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,its totally chill we get it
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,He seemed alright
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,We asked him if he had any last questions
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,and he said
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,so we were like chill
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,we will contact you soon
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Had a couple other prospectives view the place and decided to go with him as out co-tenant
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Through out the  days he lived with us
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Id seen him hit the bong on two different occasions
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,and smoke out of a pipe but I dont distincly remember smelling weed
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,brushed it off
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,All attempted conversations with this guy ended with him saying
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,sorry Im just too fucking high
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,so Im like sure no problem do what makes you feel comfortable or whatever
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Like go in your room
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,go to sleep
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,drink some water
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,My roommate also smokes dabs time to time
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,as well as my partner who comes over frequently
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,No more than  dabs are taken over the course of  hours
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Other really uncomfortable situations happened also took place
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,but not really connected to the main issue
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,he packs up all his shit at two a
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,my partner works nights so I was awake still and VERY confused
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,I was hey
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,is everything ok
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,but I just gotta go
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,you guys need to find someone to cover the lease  Uh
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,We need to talk about this as a house hold tomorrow
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,But like whats up
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Is there anything going on
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Is there something that I can help with
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,you guys are cool people
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,but you gotta find someone else
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Blah blah Im just too fucking high this phrase I heard over  times in the time he lived with us
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Not an exaggeration
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,what is he high on
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Ive only seen him smoke weed a max of  times in those  days
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,So I was ok doesnt seem like he want to reconcile
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Well talk in the morning
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Hes having a conversation with my roommate
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,who is also very confused
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Asking what is going on
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Why are you feeling like you have to leave
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,You have a legal responsibility for a third of the rent
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,and so forth
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,He proceed to accuse my roommate
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,and friend of ten years
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Who has a steady job
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,is never late on rent
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,and is completely coherent any time Ive talked to her
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,of DOING METH
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Saying the house smells of chemicals
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,She says thats absolutely absurd
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,There is no feasible way that she or anyone else in the house is doing that
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,this I overheard standing in the hallway
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,I come out at that point to join the conversation
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,He then procedures to assert the smell of chemicals is coming from my room
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,I have been sober from weed for two months and have never smoked in my room
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,I tell him that
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,and say that the only smoking done in this house takes place at the dining room table or out on the porch
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,my roommate asks him if he has any mental diagnosis that include paranoia as we are a neurodivergent household and understand this my roomie has a mental diagnosis
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,I have BPI know paranoia and psychosis
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,I have a feeling he was maybe smoking meth
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,since that accusation came out of nowhere Alcoholics accuse people of drinking cheaters accuse people of cheating
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,-he has no jobSays hes doin online school
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,but neither of us know that for sure
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,-his parents also very against co-signing for him
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Is he a possible meth user or is he psychotic
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,Thank you for bearing with me until the end
s0e2kn,t5_2tyg2,I am really in need for some confirmation and clarity

rre5sx,t5_2qlaa,GerdLPR help So in the past couple months Ive learnt to live through this nightmare that randomly started
rre5sx,t5_2qlaa,I started experiencing the sore throats and headaches
rre5sx,t5_2qlaa,Today tho I woke up with pain in the roof of my mouth when I sallow
rre5sx,t5_2qlaa,Kinda feels like when you burn the roof of youre mouth
rre5sx,t5_2qlaa,I feel like kinda a rash or something really small there on either side of the roof of my mouth
rre5sx,t5_2qlaa,I should add in I did throw up Monday night and had a lot of acid reflux come up which has since gone away
rre5sx,t5_2qlaa,I have a doctors appointment next week but any insight to put my mind at ease or experiences would be great to know if this is a new symptom
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,JAE My daughter now  was diagnosed  months ago with JAE
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,We have tried different meds Ethosuximide
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,Lamictal but these have been unsuccessful in controlling the seizures
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,She has been on epilim chrono building up slowly for  weeks and I am not seeing any improvement
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,We were told to give it  weeks
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,Has anyone had any experience of this medication
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,Should we be seeing results at this stage
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,She is exhausted and teary and this seems to be making everything worse
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,She could get up to  head nods in  minutes and it can take her  minutes to recover whereas with lamictal seizures were more frequent but she recovered faster
rvxurf,t5_2s1h9,Any information on how long seizure control takes from original diagnosis would be appreciated
rm9b67,t5_2s1h9,Can someone please recommend the most potentstrongeffective CBD oil please I am so over this condition i was sobbing yesterday
rm9b67,t5_2s1h9,please help me
su9s94,t5_2saq9,Symptoms improve with less sleep
su9s94,t5_2saq9,I have noticed a trend the past year
su9s94,t5_2saq9,Whenever I sleep hrs I tend to suffer less from lightheadednessfatigueconstant fog throughout the day
su9s94,t5_2saq9,The longer I sleep hrs the worse my symptoms are
su9s94,t5_2saq9,Dont get me wrong
su9s94,t5_2saq9,whenever I sleep -hrs I feel terrible from the sleep deprivation however it is  preferable to sleeping hrs and having horrible POTS symptoms
su9s94,t5_2saq9,I think since nothing is working for me Im going to try and sleep -hrs a day to treat my POTS
su9s94,t5_2saq9,Of course this is probably going to be detrimental for my health but so are these POTS medications
su9s94,t5_2saq9,I also seem to notice a similar relief of symptoms the day after consuming alcohol
su9s94,t5_2saq9,I assume that it is because after consuming alcohol
su9s94,t5_2saq9,as well as being sleep deprived
su9s94,t5_2saq9,my heart pumps harderand more efficiently
su9s94,t5_2saq9, this is what Ive noticed in my situation
su9s94,t5_2saq9,Anyone can relate to this
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Dying to eat after what could be potentially bad GERD Hi there everyone
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I need help
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Its been a few days and I cant seem to eat or have normal bowel function after a Gerd flare
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,The first time I got sick was on  November and I had been sick for  to  days
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Doctor said there were three possibilities GERD
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Gallstones or an obstruction in my stomach but this last one was quite rare
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I was given omerprazole
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,anti nausea meds and was told to have a clean diet
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Im sorry to admit that I cheated a bit after having lemon and herb marinated grilled chicken and beef stroganoff made with soy milk and pasta but for the most part my diet was weetbix in the morning
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,a legume salad with chicken or tuna and a small snack for dinner apples or bananas
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Anyways I used the Omerprazole until I ran out of it and after that a few days passed without incident although I did start developing a sore throat
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Then after that I got ill again
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,What a nightmare
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,This time it was almost exactly a month later and it was worse
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I mean bad
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I kept coughing and vomiting up saliva
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,My stomach felt like a churning pot of bubbles and I couldnt have normal bowel movement at all
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I even started getting the flavor of having recently eaten an orange on my tongue
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Once again I rushed to a doctor who gave me Lansoprazole
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,This didnt help at all and I saw no improvement
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I rushed to the hospital again on Christmas Day in tears
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,scared for my life and the doctor just dispassionate looked at me and said
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I was basically told to figure it out myself
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,I have successfully acquired appointments for the th of January but now how do I get there alive and in one piece
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,Im really struggling to eat and I think because my stomach is so empty
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,the acid is going berserk
rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,What do I do to get something in my body
qd43wt,t5_2syer,Debating on trying Colchicine for the first time Ive only ever had one big flare before
qd43wt,t5_2syer,got my UA checked and it shot up to 
qd43wt,t5_2syer,supposedly due to inflammation from an unrelated infection
qd43wt,t5_2syer,Doc gave me a scrip for 
qd43wt,t5_2syer, mg of Colchicine
qd43wt,t5_2syer,and i do have some soreness and tenderness in my ankle and a mild limp right now
qd43wt,t5_2syer,but nothing like the one bad flare i had
qd43wt,t5_2syer,Im kinda scared to try this
qd43wt,t5_2syer,Has anyone barfed because of it
qd43wt,t5_2syer,How long does it take to kick in
qd43wt,t5_2syer,Does it set things straight
qd43wt,t5_2syer,or does it just wear off and youre back to stiffness and moderate pain
qd43wt,t5_2syer,Maybe wait til after dinner and take before bed
srk5w8,t5_2tyg2,I think my boyfriend is schizophrenic
srk5w8,t5_2tyg2,He honestly believes God wants to take him on a mission in heaven
srk5w8,t5_2tyg2,He is abandoning his son and I to go be with God
srk5w8,t5_2tyg2,I would also encourage advice from spiritualists
srk5w8,t5_2tyg2,as he thinks he is a medium
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,My gf is about to switch from once a day copaxon injections to aubagio at the advice of her new neurologist
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,After doing some research before starting the treatment
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,she is a bit worried about the liver function concerns with the drug
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,My gf is bipolar
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,has high anxiety
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,and is on several meds for her mental health
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,I just pulled up a site that compared these  drugs and was really angry to see that copaxone patients reported it caused depression
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,and other things the doctor never mentioned
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,So I am cautiously optimistic that the change is in her best interest
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,Any thoughts or experiences would be greatly appreciated
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,My research seems to lean towards the new medication
ss1qxg,t5_2s23e,but we are obviously concerned at least about the liver function monitoring
rednpn,t5_2rtve,I have been struggling with lupus symptoms for a few years
rednpn,t5_2rtve,but they were milder so I couldnt get an official diagnosis
rednpn,t5_2rtve,This past week I started a flare up and I was finally diagnosed via symptoms and blood work
rednpn,t5_2rtve,I was referred to a rheumatologist
rednpn,t5_2rtve,and I hope to get an appointment soon
rednpn,t5_2rtve,What can I expect from my first visits
rednpn,t5_2rtve,The general physician gave me low dose prednisone for five days to take and hopefully ease up symptoms until the specialist can get me in
rednpn,t5_2rtve,I know kidneys can be an issue
rednpn,t5_2rtve,but they said my labs showed kidney function was fine right now
rednpn,t5_2rtve,Will my flare ups slowly get worse
rednpn,t5_2rtve,Are there treatments that minimize them
rednpn,t5_2rtve,I feel like this is my worst flare up because of the stress I am currently under my daughter has leukemia
rednpn,t5_2rtve,but I am just unsure of how this illness progresses
rednpn,t5_2rtve,Any info or advice is greatly appreciated
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,This may be a dumb question
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,but How do you know if you have epilepsy versus just having some one-off seizures
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,I just read about someone who was diagnosed after having  in one year
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,Ive had my first  in the past 
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,and I suspect I had another - before that due to tongue biting in my sleep and a HUGE bruise on my ass like a - of one of my ass cheeks with no recollection of how it got there
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,Unfortunately I didnt put  and  together sooner
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,Is it based on how often you have seizures or is it something else
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,The internet says running tests will likely happen
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,but I have no idea what triggers me or anything like that
rxj8d9,t5_2s1h9,Also any heads up on what to expect during tests would be gladly appreciated

rnkrgc,t5_2qlaa,So hernias cant go away without surgery
rnkrgc,t5_2qlaa,but there are people who have hiatal hernias but dont know it
rnkrgc,t5_2qlaa,because they have  symptoms

opa0b6,t5_2r876,Intermittent fasting and Trikafta I have been finding that only eating within an  hour window is massively improving my gut symptoms
opa0b6,t5_2r876,however as the night time dose is supposed to be taken  hours after the morning one
opa0b6,t5_2r876,Im in a bit of a dilemma
opa0b6,t5_2r876,Does anyone know if  hours between doses is way too little
opa0b6,t5_2r876,Ive done  hours apart fine but  seems like its too short
opa0b6,t5_2r876,Or does anyone else here eat within a similar  or  hour window and if so how do you manage to take both your Trikafta doses
opa0b6,t5_2r876,I have been debating dropping the night one anyway as its still giving me insomnia
opa0b6,t5_2r876,Any advice would be much appreciated thanks
ry2raf,t5_2tyg2,Does believing a delusion make you physically stronger or weaker
ry2raf,t5_2tyg2,This is in regards to this
ry2raf,t5_2tyg2,comukhealthmental-healthais-lying-making-your-muscles-weaker  We already know that telling a lie makes you weaker
ry2raf,t5_2tyg2,but if you are psychotic and succumb to a delusion
ry2raf,t5_2tyg2,like falsely believing you were born in France when you were born in Japan
ry2raf,t5_2tyg2,what does it to do your physical strength
ry2raf,t5_2tyg2,Has anyone ever tried if the muscle test applies to the psychotic

sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,As the title says I am wondering how much sodium I should be consuming per day
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,I am not officially diagnosed
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,but it is highly suspected that I have POTS
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,I have a tilt table test scheduled for March st
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,My cardiologist recommended that I consume 
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,mg of sodium per day and L of water
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,My issue is I am a very small woman
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9, and  pounds
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,I drink one packet of Liquid IV and take  capsules of Vitassium per day
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,I tried the LMNT packets
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,but they made me sick
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,I genuinely dont know how I could consume more sodium than I already do
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,Not to mention if I consumed L of water per day I would not be eating any food as I would be constantly full from all that water
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,I also have interstitial cystitis and a lot of high sodium foods contain ingredients that irritate my bladder
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,Is the -G per day just a recommendation
sm8tb6,t5_2saq9,How much sodium and water do you typically consume per day
rhcvgl,t5_2qlaa,Does the omeperazole cause anxiety
rhcvgl,t5_2qlaa,I was prescribed PPIs as my doctor thought that reflux was effecting my vagus nerve and causing me to have palpitations as eating would cause my palps to intensify very observably
rhcvgl,t5_2qlaa,I was extremely anxious as palps scare me quite substantially
rhcvgl,t5_2qlaa,I have been taking mg mg x  daily
rhcvgl,t5_2qlaa,My anxiety is literally out of control

sizrib,t5_2tyg2,Experienced substance induced psychosis  realized Im a freaking addict I started doing weed to help with fibromyalgia pains
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,but very quickly it became a daily thing  I was high  of the time
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,Two weeks ago
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,I got psychosis and it was really bad
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,My husband called the ambulance and they took me to a psychiatric hospital
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,Fortunately the psychosis only lasted about  hours and Ive been fine ever since
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,more or less fine
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,I was absolutely sure that Im not addicted to weed
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,but I am
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,I really really am
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,come from a family of addicts and have promised myself that I will never ever become like them
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,I didnt do drugs
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,I dont drink
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,But then weed happened and it made existing a bliss
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,And now
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,Im experiencing the worst cravings of my life
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,Im so restless and tired and I just wanna smoke marijuana so freaking bad omg
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,It can never happen again though
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,My therapist whose second job is working as a psychiatrist in a childrens hospital told me about how bad weed induced psychosis can get if it happens more than once
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,That there are people who will never come out of it because antipsych meds simply do not work on them
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,And Im afraid
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,Because Im not sure that I can stay away
sizrib,t5_2tyg2,Im afraid of completely screwing up my whole life because I
oyb963,t5_2r876,Fear of death The level of treatment I have access to is an enormous  blessing that I do not take for granted for one second
oyb963,t5_2r876,but as many people have discussed theres a kind of weird psychological crisis you go through where enough time seems on the table for you that it reframes you perspective towards life
oyb963,t5_2r876,Not just time of course
oyb963,t5_2r876,because I personally feel I still only have a few years in the tank
oyb963,t5_2r876,but the quality of life that makes all the difference for example
oyb963,t5_2r876,if I was in crap health and had two years
oyb963,t5_2r876,I wouldnt enroll in school because thats not how i want to fill the time
oyb963,t5_2r876,but if I had three years and felt amazing maybe Id be up to it since Id have the energy to tackle it
oyb963,t5_2r876,I know some people are talking about
oyb963,t5_2r876,I wasnt supposed to be here
oyb963,t5_2r876,what do I do with myself now
oyb963,t5_2r876, But right now my thing is more
oyb963,t5_2r876,and I know this is horrible to say
oyb963,t5_2r876,I was kind of counting on being gone right now with the one silver living that I wouldnt have to watch everyone around me go
oyb963,t5_2r876,We dont know when that time is going to come for anyone
oyb963,t5_2r876,but I see friends and family getting older and sicker or if theyre healthier
oyb963,t5_2r876,their stories turning out more shit when they make bad choices and it feels like my life is just beginning but only with enough window to see the end of everyone elses
oyb963,t5_2r876,So my fear of death isnt necessarily for myself I cant feel that anymore as Im overexposed to it but more about death broadly
oyb963,t5_2r876,Ive had such a bad experience a long time ago with someone close that it feeling like its hanging around the corner waiting to snatch up everyone I care about
oyb963,t5_2r876,it makes it hard to function
oyb963,t5_2r876,And theres no outlet
oyb963,t5_2r876,I cant talk to the people it concerns I am willing to but they personally arent comfortable or willing or able and therapy kind of things seem to go nowhere
oyb963,t5_2r876,I feel I am actually pretty well-adjusted and have never properly screened for a clinical mental issuejust thinking out loud as far as coping mechanisms
oyb963,t5_2r876,It sometimes feels like it manifests as physical pain
sc33gt,t5_2saq9,What is your bpm when standing
sc33gt,t5_2saq9,What is your bpm when you go from laying in bed to standing
sc33gt,t5_2saq9,I went from  to  this morning and then it went down to  but it never got below that even  minutes later
sc33gt,t5_2saq9,So my bpm is  bpm higher when standing

otkct6,t5_2syer,Hello fellow sufferers  Been going through a hell of an attack that has slowly moved around my left foot
otkct6,t5_2syer,I live in an extremely hot and humid climateNew Orleans
otkct6,t5_2syer,I work outside for half the day and also play tennis so I am basically sweating all day long during the late spring to early fall
otkct6,t5_2syer,I constantly drink water and dont mind it at all
otkct6,t5_2syer,but was wondering  Is there a better choice to stay hydrated and flush out the kidneys
otkct6,t5_2syer,Ive heard lemon water
otkct6,t5_2syer,but never tried it
otkct6,t5_2syer,Dont mind squeezing lemon in a big jug of HO at all
otkct6,t5_2syer,How about always adding salt or baking soda
otkct6,t5_2syer,How about any other additives
otkct6,t5_2syer,My wife and I came up with a lemon
otkct6,t5_2syer,gingercinnamoncayenne mixture thats pretty nice but I have know idea if its actually helpful

rksppz,t5_2qlaa,Any backpackersscramblersmountaineers have tips
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,Im hoping to spend most of the next year outside doing lots of fun alpine things since Ive got some time off work but there are a couple things Ive struggled with in the past trying to manage gerd in the backcountry
rksppz,t5_2qlaa, its really hard to eat enough
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,I really need to eat small meals or else I feel disgusting and I also am sensitive to certain kinds of foods
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,like nut bars or trail mix which used to be a go-to make me feel so sick
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,But its obviously crucial to stay well fed when youre working so hard all day long
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,Im curious if others have found safe and calorie dense foods to eat andor ways of eating that dont aggravate your gerd but allow you to eat enough
rksppz,t5_2qlaa, sleeping on the ground
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,At home I have the head of my bed raised and it helps so much
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,If there are a couple nights where I dont sleep at home its just a little scratchy throat but after a few days it starts to get worse so Im curious if anyone has any backcountry set ups that work well for raising the top half of your body a bit while sleeping
rksppz,t5_2qlaa,Any other thoughtstips on GERD and the outdoors are welcome too

phj53q,t5_2syer,Long story short swelling and extreme pain are gone however it still lingers at the joint
phj53q,t5_2syer,I started wearing shoes again a few days ago but it has to be loose
phj53q,t5_2syer,I golf and if I practice swing just to test the joint still hurts
phj53q,t5_2syer,Since I am a noob at this how long before you are back to normal
phj53q,t5_2syer,I keep seeing - days but Im past it
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Im a bit mad and a bit sad Hey rIBS
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Im not sure if this is the right place to post this
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,but I think it might help me process my situation by just getting it out
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I dont really post in this sub
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,but I love reading all the posts and seeing how supportive this community is
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Just reading other peoples posts has really helped me over the years    TLDR  Doctors never tested me for coeliac as part of IBS diagnosis at age 
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1, years on I request the test myself and its positive
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,  Here is my story   Ten years ago at the ripe old age of  my digestion issues started
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,With a childhood history of constipation
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,and I was battling with constant nausea
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,trapped wind and more
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Eventually my mum takes me to the doctor and they test me for everything
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,All my bloods come back normal-ish
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Life goes on
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,just a little more shtty lol
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,At  I finally got my period and things got a bit worse
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,My digestion issues got a bit worse
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I was more iron deficient and the migraines started
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Over the next year or two I get more blood tests
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,more normal-ish ranges for most things
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Im told because there is nothing wrong with me
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,so I have IBS
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Here we welcome all the damaging comments from friends
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,class-mates and health professionals  at least youre not as sick as so and so uhh no Ive just delt with it longer and dont talk about it as much
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,at least youre not coeliac or have Crohns  at least your body isnt actually attacking itself HAHAHA JUST WAIT  Them I feel sick today can you help me
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,me Im really sorry Im not feeling too well myself
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I cant really help no
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,them but youre at school
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,but you look fine
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Its really not a competition you know  its just the runs
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,its just nausea its just insert any symptom  its all in your head  IBS isnt a real health issue  no
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,you cant be sick constantly
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Because I see youre still living your life  at least youve never pooped yourself HAHA Its not something I publicize  After years of trying to figure out what makes me sick and what doesnt
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Ive cut out a bunch of foods
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,or only eat them in small quantities
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,and other foods I just cop the consequences because I want to live a normal life on the outside
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,so Id rather just suffer quietly on the inside  in my loo
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I have found my diet particularly hard
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,because even when I cut out EVERY major trigger food and tried to follow diets I was still getting mild symptoms
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,So why not just suffer a little bit more if it means I get to socialize a little bit more
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Sounded like a fair trade off to me considering I never received any advice on my diet and everything I knew was research done by a teenager
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,After about  years
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,and finishing school I decided
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,this is the way I am made but its ok
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Im resilient and yes
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I do suffer
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,but I wont talk about it because it doesnt achieve anything
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Id prefer not to talk about it because I was over the damaging comments
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I was honestly coping ok because mentally I felt like I had to
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,If I focused on my symptoms I would not be living
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,The last  years things have got a little bit worse again
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Urgency to poop has increased along with frequency of diarrhea and very foul-smelling farts
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,development of lactose intolerance
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,just generally feeling like trash
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,This starts to really impact my mental health
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,But ya know
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,thats just the way I am so its ok
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I start to eat low fodmaps and do feel a bit better
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Things are ok because they have to be ok
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Now heres where my story gets a bit spicy
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1, months ago my very healthy he literally is never unwell partner is sick for about  weeks and gets tested for a bunch of things
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,one of them coeliac
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,He tests positive
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Everyone is shocked because he has never had any digestive or non-specific coeliac symptoms
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,He is honestly so well
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,After some research I realized wow
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,a lot of my symptoms  health concerns both digestive and nondigestive
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,sound like coeliac symptoms I should make sure I was tested
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I sifted through all my old blood tests online for the past  years and NOT A SINGLE DOCTOR tested me for coeliac
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I requested this myself and I tested positive
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,For the past  years I have been suffering as an undiagnosed coeliac that has  of the most common symptoms
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,No one has ever listened to me
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I feel so ignored
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,missed and like the health system has failed me
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Part of the IBS diagnosis is being tested for coeliac
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,so how has this been missed by so many doctors
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,After speaking to a specialist
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,she thinks my IBS COULD not  certain be induced by the coeliac because of the ongoing damage in subjecting my bowels to by eating gluten
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,So maybe I could eat onions again in the future
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,As I said
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I was coping with my symptoms
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,its just the way I was and something I just had to deal with
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I am not coping
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I know what is causing my symptoms Im so angry
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I feel like Im grieving for my younger self
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,The teenager who took so much time off school
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,the uni student who struggled to concentrate
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,and the  year old who pooped herself in the kitchen
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,All of this could have been prevented if someone had just tested me which is supposed to be part of the IBS diagnosis
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I wish I was able to advocate for myself at the time
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,but  yo me just didnt know
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I now feel like Im super conscious of my symptoms and Im hyper fixating on them
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,In  more weeks
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I know it will all be over
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Ill have my gastroscopy to see how bad the damage is then I can go gluten free
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I just have to last  more weeks but Im struggling
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,I feel like all food is hurting me and forcing myself to eat something I know is making me sick is so hard
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Wow that was a little bit of a ramble
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,but I do feel better for writing it I just needed somewhere to speak my mind and my frustrations
suaw4i,t5_2s3g1,Thanks for coming to my ted talk

ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,Three Months gone I was 
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,months seizure free
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,And now Im not
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,It doesnt matter how long I go
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,this feeling is just so disappointing
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,I hate it
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,I was hopeful that coming off of divalproex and levetiracitam was the trick because my response was so immediate and positive
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,From  GTC seizures in  weeks to zero at all for 
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,Now theyre back for no rhyme or reason and I rang in  still nursing a concussion
ru3s3k,t5_2s1h9,Just needed to gripe
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,Recent diagnosis Ive had epilepsy for  years
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,but was only recently diagnosed
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,like within the past two years
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,My seizures started occurring during puberty
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,and because they werent really bad tonic clonic movie seizures I brushed them off as bad headaches
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,My seizures started getting worse
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,which is why I started thinking something was wrong and ended up going to an ER a couple months into COVIDs beginnings because I had another weird headache but when I tried to call my dad I couldnt talk
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,My right arm was shaking like crazy
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,I dont think Id ever tried to talk during a seizure before
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,so I never realized I couldnt
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,Scared the crap out of me
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,He wasnt allowed to go in with me
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,early Covid protocols
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,I was alone for hours
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,Wondering what was going on
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,Dont remember anything else the nurse said except seizure
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,and when I was confused
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,she tried to backtrack because she realized the doctor hadnt talked to me yet
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,Even now Im not fully sure whats going on
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,I know I have a mixture of focal and absent 
rlx70m,t5_2s1h9,I only really know one or two of my triggers

sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,Tired of trying to continue walking
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,Obviously not everybody with MS ends up using a wheelchair but those who do
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,whenwhy did you start
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,Im  SPMS using walkers
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,crutches for years but because of being more sedentary since covid before I did pool xs week my legs are so weak and hurt so much when I walk more than  feet with walker
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,I can use in house but I also have bad back issues too so I cant stand at sink for more than minutes
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,Im thinking its time to just use a wheelchair when Im out
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,I have always thought it is better to keep trying with walker but just have been ending up with more pain and less resilience and even avoiding going anywhere
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,Would appreciate advice from wheelchair users
sr3zrk,t5_2s23e,Thanks my friends

sod2gh,t5_2rtve,Flare after third moderna dose
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,Im curious if anyone else experienced a flare after a dose of the vaccine
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,I had read that vaccines are highly unlikely to cause flares but not sure how true that is
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,I have lupus pannicullitis affects the skin and the layer of fat below and a semi inactive lesion on my leg is literally throbbing the day after the vaccine
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,I also have another scar on my scalp which is throbbing so much its basically radiating into a neck ache and headache on that side
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,Other than that
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,im feeling pretty worse for wear muscle cramps
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,body just feels completely worn out
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,But I was expecting those general symptoms
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,just not the flaring of some of my problem areas
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,Has anyone else experienced similar following a vaccine dose
sod2gh,t5_2rtve,Im not sure whether its due to the vaccine or coincidence but it hurts horribly

rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,chest pain and mild swallowing troubles in the esophagus since years how likely is cancer
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Am i panicking for a reason
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Im sure there is many like me who panic and come here
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,but i really am not having mild panic anymore
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,its getting too much to handle
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,so until i can finally get a docs appointment covid makes it hard to get one currently i thought i could at least hear some calming words possibly
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Short-ish history Ive had stronger issues with heartburn
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,acid-reflux and such for about  years now
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,I didnt simply ignore it i first tried to make it go away by using sodium bicarbonate
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,which helped a little but ultimately not anymore for the first year
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Then i used pantropazole for  years  mg per day
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,which is a PPI surpresser most of you probably know
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,It certainly made the symptoms go away  but i knew it was still there
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,just not feeling it as much
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Finally i decided to not take it anymore and instead focus on eating better
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,drinking less alcohol
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,and taking various supplements that a nutrionist recommended to me and finally
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,im feeling a lot better than ever
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,with even the meals or drinks that used to immediatly flare me up
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,not being remotely hard on me anymore
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Let it be noted
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,that im quite a heavy smoker about  cigs a day and also had a drinking problem throughout those  years roughly  units of alcohol per week
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,which im now trying to quit as well
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Also my life in those years was very stressful
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,which is luckily finally slowing down as well
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,I have never felt better regarding the symptoms
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,but it could also just be a the beginning of a worse stage
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,where the symptos disappear barret syndrome as ive read which i clearly have done way too much
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,ive definitely decided that i want this checked out NOW
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,even if its so late into the thing
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,How high are the chances of this actually being something that cant be fixed anymore
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Like esophageal cancer
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Especially worried about the lump-like thing that sometimes prevents me from swallowing food down more easily behind my chest
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Could that just be a stricture
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,Im  by the way and im totally feeling stupid for all of it and dont want to wait longer
rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,but i really am getting scared

spfitp,t5_2tyg2,Is some psychosis an overwhelming rush of realised trauma which pushes perceived realities boundaries
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Terrified for my dad My dad just got diagnosed with potentially temporal lobe epilepsy
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,He is  years old and has had three tonic clonic seizures and several focal seizures within a month
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,For a few months before that he had some symptoms that he interpreted as panic attacks probably seizures
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,The months leading up to his first tonic clonic was extremely stressful for him which maybe contributed to all this
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Everything with this has been so damn scary
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Some questions    	Is it common that that you get so many seizures close in time when you are first diagnosed with epilepsy
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9, Recovery time especially after the tonic clonics has been around  days for my dad
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,During this time he is not himself at all very sleepy
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,very poor memory
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Is this normal and can anything be done to shorten this time
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,He has hardly been himself between the attacks because they have been so close and recovery is so long
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,  He was put on Keppra after the second tonic clonic but after a few days on Keppra he talked like he had dementia
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Extremely confused and like he was almost not there
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Doctors thought Keppra might have contributed to this and switched to Tegretol slow release
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Does anyone else have had this experience with Keppra
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,Im terrified he will keep having tonic clonics this often given his recovery time
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,That would be like losing my dad and be absolutely horrifying for him
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,He has been on Tegretol for a few days now and so far no new seizures but Im really scared he will get new ones
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,   If he has new seizures on his new medicine within the next few weeks
rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,does that mean this medicine is not working
rusqbr,t5_2s1h9,Is this a sort of epilepsy or anxiety

sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,Are compression socks worth the discomfort
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,My POTS symptoms have improved drastically since starting propanolol and Adderall which treats my newly diagnosed ADD as well as the constant POTS fatigue
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,But I have not tried compression socks
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,I still get overheated really easily and usually prefer to be barefoot at home and in sandals in public
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,so wearing socks at all regularly would be a lifestyle change for me
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,I also get painful ingrown nails frequently and the added pressure from socks makes them worse
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,Do you all find compression socks make that big of a difference
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,Are there any toeless options or compression options for the body instead
sr6wu0,t5_2saq9,Any advice and links are appreciated

rhq241,t5_2s1h9,Seeking advice about wearing a  day heart monitor
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,My husband has epilepsy
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,He recently had a fall that was not connected to a seizure
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,but he lost his balance badly
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,Due to the vertigo
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,his neurologist has ordered that he wear a  day heart monitor
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,which he received two days ago
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,The discomfort he has experienced from the device has disrupted his sleep so much that he has removed it and wont put it back on
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,It pulls on his skin and chest hair
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,and having a plastic box stuck on his chest makes it impossible to sleep in a comfortable position
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,Has anyone here used one of these
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,Do you have any advice
rhq241,t5_2s1h9,I worry that failing to have this information will compromise the doctors ability to diagnose a potentially dangerous problem

p0e2u1,t5_2syer,I think my current

p0e2u1,t5_2syer,I also have a prescription for allo

rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Just checking Im doing the right thing for Epileptic person
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Long time lister
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,first time caller
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,I care for someone with frontal lobe epilepsy with secondary generalisation
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Theyve had  seizures in total since July and currently take mg of Keppra and self medicate with a little cannabis to ease side effects
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,no other issues
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,We think the seizures are blood sugar related so he has a good diet and makes sure he eats enough
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,my person had a sickness and diarrhea bug and was very poorly for most of yesterday
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,throwing up almost every  minutes for hours and as a result
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,didnt take their Keppra as they couldnt injest food and didnt want to throw it back up again
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,I did my best to keep sugar levels up with sugary juice drinks and made sure they had plenty of water
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,They did manage a little bit of soup and bread
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,but not enough for a days worth of food
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,theyre feeling much better and have eaten plenty but around pm suffered their th tonic clonic seizure for around  minutes
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,resting in bed and recovering but I had a few questions which I was hoping you could help me with  
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Taking Keppra after a seizure
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,how long should someone wait before taking it if they have a seizure but are due a dose
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Is there a recommended or is it just as soon as possible
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,do we have any other general rules of thumb when it comes to paracetamol or other over the counter pain medication and mixing with Keppra after a seizure
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Im assuming that because this was a bug
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,the low blood sugar
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,fever and lack of medication yesterday and Im guessing because theyve now eaten
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,their blood sugar has spiked and its triggered the reaction as such
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Would I be accurate in thinking this
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,It seems relatively conclusive too me but I just want to make sure Im not missing something which could also be a factor
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,They were very warm so Id argue it could have been fever related too
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Sleep after a seizure are there any rules
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Ive let them rest in bed since and they dropped off about  minutes after recovering so were well back to being conscious and cohesive but I wondered if maybe we should wait for longer in the future before going to sleep afterwards
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Whats the best thing for tongue bites
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,My person bites the same place every time and its very sore for a few days afterwards
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Do you have any advice that could make that a little more pleasant whilst its healing
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,My person always ends up with a very sore tummy afterwards
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,They are sometimes sick but not always
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Is this normal and is there anything we can do to sooth this
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Thank you for reading
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Ill appreciate any advice you have to offer
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,I just want to make sure my person is getting the best care from me as possible
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,Its shitty when theyve gone from being fit as a fiddle to Epileptic and hes understandably scared
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,I just want to do anything I can to make this process easier
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,That is absolutely my goal here
rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,I hope that comes across

rremp4,t5_2s1h9,I also gave up drinking to help with seizures which limits things and thats what I used to do with my not as close friends

rremp4,t5_2s1h9,It feels so hard to meet people unless theyre a friend of one of my close friends or online

sxqqjz,t5_2syer,This has been the worst flare of my life
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,Im two months in and it has been agonizing
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,I started with gout in my right knee and ankle
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,Ive been on everything from colchicine
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,On tons of pain meds from toradol iv to Kerolac  to percocet to oxygen
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,Ive had my knee aspirated and my ankle tapped in the emergency room
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,I had covid back in Dec
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,Nothing has helped except the iv pain meds when I was in the emergency room
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,I was bedridden for the first  weeks and then the following two weeks with enough pain meds I was able to get to a computer chair
sxqqjz,t5_2syer, weeks in I was finally able to put weight on my legs and I was so happy I planned a small staycation trip for the family so we can get out and get some air
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,I did a small wigglecouldnt fully dance with the kids bc I was excited and the next day my right knee flared and I was back to being bedridden
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,A week later I was able to put weight on the foot and then the next day my ankle flared
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,A week later my foot started feeling better and I was excited and tried to gently exercise using a device you can put under the table
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,The next day my gout flared again
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,Here I am a week later my foot starting to heal
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,In my mind I was going to be extra careful

sxqqjz,t5_2syer,to her it has now become the norm every time I get another flare
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,but to me its not
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,Its an infinitely horrible feeling that goes deep to the bottom of my soul knowing the pain that is to come and it never gets better no matter how many times it happens
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,I feel so alone in my pain
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,I havent slept at all this week and i just feel so distraught
sxqqjz,t5_2syer,I was wondering if there were any support groups for people like me

sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Lhermittes from a cough or deep breath
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,DMT started day after Christmas
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,and just did a  day round of 
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,g solumedrol no oral taper a week ago due to a handful of new symptoms including vision issues and what the doc thinks is Lhermittes
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,First L experience was from a cough shocked my entire upper body so bad it made me cry
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Started between my shoulder blades and quickly radiated throughout my torso
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,down to my waist
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,up to the base of my skull
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,and down to my fingertips
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Throughout the last month
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,its been varying degrees
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Sometimes just a light buzz
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,sometimes I feel like Ive stuck my finger in a light socket
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Happens when I cough
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,clear my throat
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,or take a fast deep breath or exhale hard
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,a week after steroid infusions were done
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,the damn electric shocks are full body
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,I feel it everywhere except my head when I cough
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,clear my throat
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,or breathe sharply
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Am I losing my mind
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,I almost wish I was imagining this
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,It only lasts a few seconds but those few seconds really suck
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Ive gotten to the point where Im really trying to keep my breathing light and Im scared to cough
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,The cough started with the DMT
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,doc doesnt know why
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e, Sorry for such a long explanation
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,TLDR Do any of you get similar feelings from similar actions
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,Ive always seen Lhermittes described as happening when you bend your neck
sbe3aj,t5_2s23e,but that doesnt happen for me

q9n8ev,t5_2syer,Anyone else feel reduced pain after cracking your joint
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,So Im a weird gout sufferer
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,I will only get gout when I sprain my ankle
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,And when I do roll the ankle
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,the pain will always be on the ankle or on top of the foot
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,I was playing golf and tripped over my pushcart
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,It was not a fall to the ground face down but still I knew a flare up was coming
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,Popped in Colchicine  Ibuprofen as soon as I got home but surely by Thursday I was feeling some pretty severe pain and discomfort around my ankle
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,This morning I felt it getting better and had some more movement
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,So I was just trying to massage the area a little bit to get some more movement when suddenly I felt a major crack around the ankle as if I almost dislocated it
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,Obviously I was in tears for few seconds but  mins after
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,the pain is almost gone
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,Ive read some posts here about people cracking their joints post gout attack but this was the first time for me
q9n8ev,t5_2syer,and wow it felt so great

syhulk,t5_2saq9,Do any of you get these random zap waves of lightheadedness when doing virtually nothing
syhulk,t5_2saq9,I get them when sitting in my computer chair doing nothing but typing or watching something on the screen
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Or I could simply move one arm a little distance to reach for the mouse or one leg just to move it over a bit and I get this zap lightheadedness that hits briefly and is worse than the normal  lightheadedness that I get
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Its like a half of a second of pure syncope like Im going to faint
syhulk,t5_2saq9,but immediately goes back to just lightheaded again after the quick arm or leg move
syhulk,t5_2saq9,It doesnt always happen
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Just certain times
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Sometimes it will feel like my head
syhulk,t5_2saq9,even though Im just sitting straight looking at the screen
syhulk,t5_2saq9,is sort of moving backward and forward a little bit with my heartbeat
syhulk,t5_2saq9,odd pulling sensations like the arteries on each side of my neck a being pulled on
syhulk,t5_2saq9,I do have a segmental and somatic dysfunction of the cervical region in addition to my POTSdysautonomia diagnosis
syhulk,t5_2saq9,so maybe that is related to it
syhulk,t5_2saq9,My ears also both ring at times
syhulk,t5_2saq9,sitting or lying down
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Not sure if thats my bp going up and down or what
syhulk,t5_2saq9,My heart rate can get up to - when exercising
syhulk,t5_2saq9,but I dont get the rapid heart rate like a lot of people with POTS mention
syhulk,t5_2saq9,There have been times when it was  resting here and there
syhulk,t5_2saq9,but usually it might be around - resting
syhulk,t5_2saq9,My pulse seems to increase more when standing but not a ridiculous amount typically not over  and bp seems to go up sometimes when I lie down at night to sleep and other times it seems like it goes up when I stand up in the morning
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Hoping to get more testing and rule out Ehler Danlos
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Mast Cell Activation Syndrome
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Sjogrens dont like the idea of a chunk of the inside of my lip taken out to examine the saliva gland and a number of other issues
syhulk,t5_2saq9,I get a lot spasms sometimes in my abdomen they feel like that good feeling when youre having a stretch
syhulk,t5_2saq9,but in the abdomen area and also like that area is full of adrenaline
syhulk,t5_2saq9,Sometimes I get - rapid-fire spasms of my diaphragm
syhulk,t5_2saq9,It makes me concerned for a second or two because it feels like Im out of breath and cant breathe well for that - seconds
syhulk,t5_2saq9,then back to normal
syhulk,t5_2saq9,I doubt that my O even dops at all
syhulk,t5_2saq9,its probably just that uneasy feeling of the diaphragm
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,Quick story about gout A member of my family used to disparage others in the family for having gout
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,Shed say it was a disease caused by excessive food and drink
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,Lack of self-control
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,She had no sympathy and acted like she didnt believe it was all that painful
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,Not too long ago her foot started hurting
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,She thought she had broken it
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,It wasnt getting better
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,She went to the hospital
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,She literally cried because she was worried that the doctor was going to amputate
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,The pain was that bad
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,Those of us experienced with gout asked her about her symptoms
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,She dismissed any chance it may be gout
rwz4r3,t5_2syer,shes on allopurinol and feeling fine
s8i0h2,t5_2s23e,Hi so Im seeing the above term more and more
s8i0h2,t5_2s23e,but Im not sure exactly what is meant by this but it does not sound good

s8i0h2,t5_2s23e,Thanks in advance for whatever you have to share
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,Wife trying to help psychotic husband Im wondering how to best help my partner
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,He had a psychotic break late December although I think
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,it had been building for awhile
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,His delusions centered around religious stuff and around me
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,Hes convinced that I emotional abuse him
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,We were having some marriage issues before and we talked with a therapist who said that the behavior he is describing is not emotional abuse diagreeing with him
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,being blunt with my opinion
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,sometimes being critical
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,He keeps saying he is a victim and everything is all my fault
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,During the worst of it
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,he accused me of being a sociopath and yelling and screaming at me to confront my family for following him
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,He threatened my family
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,He was hospitalized about two weeks ago for a few days
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,He is much much calmer since then
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,But he persists in calling me emotionally abusive
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,Im trying to give him space
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,staying in different rooms
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,We have kids together though so I dont feel comfortable leaving the house entirely with him and the kids alone
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,This isnt like him at all
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,Normally he is easy going and kind
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,The psychiatrist says it was cannabis induced psychosis plus depression
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,Any advice on how to engage him
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,When he calls me abusive
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,I say I disagree but dont push it
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,I tried talking to him about normal things
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,Sometimes that works and other times he just glares at me with angry eyes
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,I want my partner back
safjrw,t5_2tyg2,I want to help him
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,Brain is a black box I cannot perceive the inside of my mind
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,Everyone else can see trauma and its effects
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,know what symptoms of what theyre having
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,know if theyre lying or not
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,know if theyre faking an emotion
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,I have mental psychosis
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,Every emotion feels like Im faking it
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,every statement about myself feels like a lie
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,every symptom of strangeness feels unimportant
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,Do I not believe in trauma
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,or did seeing my dad cheat on my mom in  and never saying anything to this day traumatize me
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,I do not know
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,I cannot know
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,It is literally impossible for me to tell if Im suffering or not
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,I cannot feel emotion as it concerns my own self
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,What Ive written is true
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,But my mind cannot comprehend it in any emotional way
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,This is my first time ever reaching out to a psychosis community
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,I do not have a therapist
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,I am on antipsychotics
sk93p4,t5_2tyg2,I have always been like this

s1e0j9,t5_2s1h9,Cure Is there any cure for Epilepsy

s1e0j9,t5_2s1h9,Is it true
s43p64,t5_2s23e,The holistic approach to MS Hi everyone I hope you are all doing well
s43p64,t5_2s23e,My wife was recently diagnosed with RRMS
s43p64,t5_2s23e,She had an extended period of pins and needles in her legs  or  years ago
s43p64,t5_2s23e,then nothing until  when she had lhermittes sign and went numb from the waist down
s43p64,t5_2s23e,Since has recovered fully and aside from some mild neuralgia and back muscle pain is perfectly healthy
s43p64,t5_2s23e,Since diagnosis she has been doing lots of research and consuming all sorts of information about MS and treatments etc
s43p64,t5_2s23e,She was due to start Gilenya this month but has now decided to take a holistic approach with diet primarily based on the Wahls Protocol
s43p64,t5_2s23e,and not take any medication other than supplements like Vitamin D etc
s43p64,t5_2s23e,I dont really agree with her approach but its her body and Ill support her  in whatever she wants to do
s43p64,t5_2s23e,but I have to admit that Im worried
s43p64,t5_2s23e,Her argument is shes had it for almost  years with little impact on her life and not looking after her diet
s43p64,t5_2s23e,so she wants to try this approach before medication
s43p64,t5_2s23e,Im worried that its risky and she could end up with preventable damage
s43p64,t5_2s23e,I was hoping that people here might have similar experiences or some knowledge that they could share to either put my mind at rest
s43p64,t5_2s23e,or could share some knowledge I can share with her to try change her mind
s43p64,t5_2s23e,Im a bit lost with this at the moment

pf3mr0,t5_2syer,Has anyone seen any long term benefits of the keto diet for uric acid control
pf3mr0,t5_2syer,Ive read a few others on YouTube claiming it was very successful for them
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,its a long one
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Hopefully someone can relate
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,So my problems started about  years ago as a teen
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Around freshman year of high school
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I started having pretty consistent diarrhea
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I bring it up to the doctor
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,they say its probably IBS without testing me and send me off
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I woke up one morning with the EXTREME urge to poop
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,like I was going to have diarrhea and had extreme nausea
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I get up to use the restroom and all of a sudden I start having shallow breathing
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,and then cant breathe
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My heart rate simultaneously goes through the roof and I started shaking because I felt cold and I am in EXTREME
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Its pain like Im being stabbed in the stomach
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I started passing out and my mom comes over and she said I looked green
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,and all the color drained from my face
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My mom is about to call an ambulance
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,but just like that
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,it stops after about  minutes
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Because many adults in my life have failed me
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,my mom did not take me to the ER since I was completely fine after
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,and a follow up with a doctor says I had whats called a vasovagal attack and ignores anything else I had to say because my blood work was fine
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Ive had one or two of these attacks every year for the last  years
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Almost always the same I wake up
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,usually very early in the morning or the middle of the night
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,always starting with stomach pain
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,and the urge to poop
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I had been to a few more doctors and all of them just said that sounds like IBS
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,just watch what you eat and thats it
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I can usually feel them coming on and try to breathe through it so I dont have a full-blown attack and if I am able to use the bathroom
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,that helps it pass sometimes
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I woke up at  am not being able to breathe
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Same symptoms as the others
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,but this time it was much worse with my heart was beating out of my chest
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I was gasping for air and in excruciating stomach pain and I was lying there
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,just like Im going to die
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My fiancé calls and ambulance and I remember blacking out
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,He said he turned me on my side and I threw up
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I came-to and remember it just suddenly stopped
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I was just really tired afterwards
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,When the ambulance got there
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,all they could tell was that my heart rate was really elevated
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I still went to the ER and had two more mini attacks to which I was ignored
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,When they finally see me
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,they only do a chest X-ray and they dont find any heart or lung damage
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,so they send me on my way
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My chest takes about a month to recover
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Sharp pain when I bend over and it just felt bruised
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I start having these attacks almost daily
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,just more mild versions
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Ive since seen at least  separate doctors and am seeing a GI specialist
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Ive been to the ER multiple times for these attacks
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,only for them to say Im having a panic attack since my blood work is fine except for maybe low iron or potassium
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My GI discovered I had h
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,very mild diverticulosis
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I have since eradicated the h
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,but am still having issues
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Ive done multiple CTs
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,endo and colonoscopy
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I have  answers other than the IBS
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I am on a very strict diet because of my gastritis
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,no rice doesnt sit well with me
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,I still have stool issues
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,but mostly semi-solid since eradicating the h
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My attacks have been less frequent an more mild since treating the h
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Pylori as well
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My GI put me on amitriptyline and it helps
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,but mostly with pain and not the diarrhea
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Does anyone else have similar IBS attacks
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,Does this even sound like IBS
sk9dkv,t5_2s3g1,My current doctors are stumped and Id rather not die

rwrkm9,t5_2s1h9,Postive things to come from epilepsy Hey everyone
rwrkm9,t5_2s1h9,Sometimes its easy to see only the negatives from living with epilepsy
rwrkm9,t5_2s1h9,I thought Id make a post to help uplift us and remind us there is good to be found in even the worst situations
rwrkm9,t5_2s1h9, seizures have made me way more mindful of my health
rwrkm9,t5_2s1h9, My family has a high risk for addiction and I was headed down that path
rwrkm9,t5_2s1h9,but my seizures snapped me out of it and made me take my health more seriously
rwrkm9,t5_2s1h9, not driving for  years has made my driving record squeaky clean lol

rsbkg0,t5_2qlaa,Nortriptyline tried to avoid TCA for as long as i could
rsbkg0,t5_2qlaa,yet here we are Just started on mg of nortriptyline and was wondering if anyone else tried itis on it
rsbkg0,t5_2qlaa,how long it took for it to start working
rsbkg0,t5_2qlaa,Im also considering upping it to mg in two weeks if nothing changes
rsbkg0,t5_2qlaa,but not sure if two weeks is enough time
p7rav1,t5_2syer,First severe flare up
p7rav1,t5_2syer,Hey guys not on any gout medication
p7rav1,t5_2syer,noticed I have gout in my right big toe - times a year
p7rav1,t5_2syer,particularly in the winter since my mid twenties
p7rav1,t5_2syer,Like an idiot I never really had it diagnosed
p7rav1,t5_2syer,Its been bad enough that I hobble for a few days and then it gets better
p7rav1,t5_2syer,over the last couple of days have been hell
p7rav1,t5_2syer,I never felt pain like it
p7rav1,t5_2syer,My body is shivering in bed and I somehow managed to sleep through the pain
p7rav1,t5_2syer,It seems managable in the day though
p7rav1,t5_2syer,I jumped on keto and noticed that it helped with reducing the amount of attacks I suffered
p7rav1,t5_2syer,That coupled with apple cider vinegar
p7rav1,t5_2syer,lemon juice and honey with boiled water everyday
p7rav1,t5_2syer,I ordered some tumeric gout tablets from Amazon and only just taken them
p7rav1,t5_2syer,Hoping theyll take off the edge
p7rav1,t5_2syer,My otc pain killer is fast acting ibuprofen and Ibuprofen targeted gel rub but they dont seem to help much
p7rav1,t5_2syer,When this episode is over
p7rav1,t5_2syer,can I get gout meds from my doctor in advance
p7rav1,t5_2syer,ready for my next flare up
p7rav1,t5_2syer,Negate when it happens
p7rav1,t5_2syer,personal circumstances make it extremely difficult to go see a doc
p7rav1,t5_2syer,how much water should I be drinking to flush out uric acids
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,New Epilepsy Diagnosis I F was just diagnosed with epilepsy
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,Ive been having seizures in my sleep for decades
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,I always thought everyone woke up feeling like theyd been hit by a bus and that I was somehow falling short by struggling so much to get to work on time
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,out of the blue
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,wake up to a floppy day my technical term for it
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,where I couldnt get out of bed or move my arms well and would sleep all day
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,I attributed this to fibromyalgia flares
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,It wasnt until I woke up one morning without the ability to move one of my arms that my doctor sent me to the hospital
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,It took about three months and a ton of tests
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,and now here I am with a new diagnosis and no clear idea of what to do next
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,Was anyone else here completely surprised by your diagnosis
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,What weird symptoms did you have
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,What did you attribute them to
rxxed7,t5_2s1h9,How did you find out you had it

retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Has your epilepsy affected relationships in anyway Romantic and Non-Romantic
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Im thinking of posting one question a day to help bring us together through discussion
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,When I was  I had my first serious relationship
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,At this time my epilepsy was
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Somewhat under control and I was going to college
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Everything was cool
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,During finals week I was heavily sleep deprived and my significant other at the time could tell I was stressed
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Mainly because I was uninterested in intimacy during that time
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,At the end of that stressful week and everything was going back to normal
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,I had a gnarly seizure while I was spe ding the night at my significant others house
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,The situation was whack to say the least
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,hospital was fun as usual and all that fun stuff
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Sadly after the incident our relationship started to deteriorate
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,After mutually agreeing to separate
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,I asked them if it had anything to do with that incident
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,they did not like seeing me in that state even though I was open with them about it
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Seeing a loved one in a tough spot can somewhat scar someone
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,I was fine with it
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,I would never put someone through that if they were unable to handle it
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,It also taught me a lot
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Hospital bills suck
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,So after telling you my experience
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,What are your experiences
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,If you dont have any
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Feel free to ask questions
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Some of us have years of experience Stacked up
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,I feel we should help those who are new to epilepsyseizures in any way possible
retuqv,t5_2s1h9,Thank you Your friend El Maestro

sosx3d,t5_2saq9,Hyperhidrosis then POTS Hi everyone
sosx3d,t5_2saq9,I was just diagnosed with POTS last week
sosx3d,t5_2saq9,so Im still figuring out everything
sosx3d,t5_2saq9,I wanted to ask if anyone has hyperhidrosis as a diagnosis first
sosx3d,t5_2saq9,followed by POTS symptoms
sosx3d,t5_2saq9,I have had hyperhidrosis since the age of  Im  now and have had fatigue
sosx3d,t5_2saq9,and some other symptoms since I got mono in the second grade
sosx3d,t5_2saq9,Has anyone else had similar experiences

swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,IBS has driven me away from healthy activities in my life and I dont know what to do anymore Years of chronic IBS-D has pulled me away from positive elements of life socializing
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1, and in their place has driven me towards negative dependencies as a means of escape over-eating
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,I dont know how to move forward at this point
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,Its like Ive been forced off a track of things which are positive and healthy and my only options to manage the loneliness and sadness are self-destructive in and of themselves
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,I want to still feel alive and be somehow engaged in the world
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,I want to recover something of my old self and feel self-worth again
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,I want to spend whatever broken years I have left growing into a better person and doing something that matters
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,I kinow this question is probably beyond the scope of this sub but I dont know where else to ask
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,Who else understands the extent of how IBS can shatter your life
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,sap your confidence
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,make you lose interest in the world around you
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,Who else knows better the way it slowly erodes your identity and redefines you as a chronically-ill shut-in with socially-disastrous symptoms
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,Sometimes I think the only answer left to me is just to cut myself off from everything
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,like go into a kind of intentional solitary zombie mode where I dont feel anything
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,dont want anything
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,dont aspire to be anything anymore
swhhxm,t5_2s3g1,Im really at a loss and Im scared no matter which way I turn Im going to continue in this decline
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,Hi everyone one of my kids just tested positive for Covid so assuming I will as well in the next few days
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,I contacted my PCP and neuro who said that as soon as I test positive they would recommend getting me on Paxlovid as long as we can find it vs monoclonal antibody infusions
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,as apparently those are not working quite as effectively against Omicron
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,Ive been doing my research on the drug but am curious if anyone has taken it yet
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,What was your experience
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,The worst side effect she mentioned was like a battery acid taste in your mouth for the entire -day regimen
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,Sounds gross but doable
sd7oxe,t5_2s23e,Thanks in advance for any insight
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,Do you tend to eat more when you have a flair
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,Im not quite sure if Im having a flair or not but I slept at least  hours last night and am still tiredsleepysemi exhausted
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,For lunch I got a free slice of pizza amd a whole plate of food flank steak and potatoes mushrooms and asparagus
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,I thought to eat the slice of pizza later but I ended up eating all of it and actually feel like I could eat more
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,I got a headache after I ate and my neck feels like its swelling a bit too
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,When I was first diagnosed I lost a ton of weight due to lack of appetite
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,I gained it back since Ive been on hydroxochloroquine
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,But Im not on any steroids or anything
qrvyte,t5_2rtve,Anyone have a similar thing

stka0p,t5_2tyg2,I am almost completely out of my psychosis and take  mg amisulpride a day
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,And when I say out of it I mean out of it
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,It feels like Im in total control of my thoughts and actions again after  years
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,Now Im wondering if the blank mind syndrome I have might be caused by it
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,I have no thought or images in my head
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,I keep having slight headaches light someone rubbed their fingers over my head too hard
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,and I have no inner monologue to speak off
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,I can only do it by murmuring that is then I suddenly hear my own voice in my head
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,but otherwise its blank
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,What do you guys think
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,Should I go down in dosage
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,That said the voices Im channelling have had no issues with the medicine and are actively saying that I need to stay on it
stka0p,t5_2tyg2,that they are probably still effecting me somehow

sbwchs,t5_2s23e,Happy surprise Doesnt really have anything to do with MS specifically but I know you folks will appreciate it
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,Im Canadian and that matters to the overall perspective of getting medications
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,Ive been in a unionized job my entire career and my med plan copay is the dispensing fee
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,So every prescription
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,I only pay 
sbwchs,t5_2s23e, it was lower a decade ago
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,In recent months
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,Ive switched to a brand new department in my organization that is permanently WFH big win
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,The union piece has been weird
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,Ive been moved temporarily to a new union but Feb  when my permanent status takes effect
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,I return to my original union and that anchors my position to my house so Im protected by driving expectations
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,if they decide this team goes by the wayside
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,my relocation to office goes back to my former office
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,Its a good thing
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,But I went and refilled  prescriptions today
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,My medical benefits plan didnt change providers but it changed administratively because I paid ZERO dollars for any prescriptions today
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,Im just going to accept this brief blessing and be prepared that it will revert back soon enough
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,For the record
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,the benefit costs a bit more on my pay and stuff right now but shit
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,it is nice
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,For the record
sbwchs,t5_2s23e,the trade off is having a shitty short term disability plan versus my original benefits have a creme de la creme STD plan

siub6o,t5_2tyg2,Always of people
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,People I have never seen in my life
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,just standing there
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,They dont often look creepy but the last few nights they have
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,They dont often make me jump or react much in any way
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,but this morning was real scary
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,a very tall shaodowy man in the corner of my room
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,I think he was wearing a suit and hat
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,I dont really tell people about them or really acknowledge them in my life but I felt like venting about it today because its honestly annoying to wake up and see a stranger standing there
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,even though I  know its not real and theyll fade away eventually
siub6o,t5_2tyg2,Its also weird that I dont really ever seen to see the same person more than once

stbmca,t5_2s23e,Burst into tears in front of my lumbar puncture doc today
stbmca,t5_2s23e,I was probably more surprised than she was that I started crying
stbmca,t5_2s23e,I was definitely a bit anxious about having the LP done
stbmca,t5_2s23e,but I dont have any fear of needles and read up enough on the procedure that I knew at worst it would just be uncomfortable
stbmca,t5_2s23e,So idk I wasnt crying cause I was scared
stbmca,t5_2s23e,I think I was just really really overwhelmed
stbmca,t5_2s23e,Ive F UK been chasing a diagnosis for about a year now with my doctors being pretty certain I have MS with the lumbar puncture being my final test to be sure
stbmca,t5_2s23e,And Ive actually gotten pretty good at just ignoring it all and trying not to think about anything until I have an answer  and I could start treatment
stbmca,t5_2s23e,So I think something like the lumbar puncture was a bit of a rude awakening on how real this all is and crying was a bit of a means to relieve a lot of my pent up emotions I guess
stbmca,t5_2s23e,Especially since I spend so much energy being upbeat around my loved ones so they dont also have to worry about my mental space
stbmca,t5_2s23e,It was definitely embarrassing lol
stbmca,t5_2s23e,but ngl a little therapeutic too
stbmca,t5_2s23e,I think Ill consider speaking to a professional once I do have a diagnosis
stbmca,t5_2s23e,Anyone else have similar experience
rj09mn,t5_2s1h9,How do people with epilepsy who play video games find out if a game can potentially bring on a seizure
rj09mn,t5_2s1h9,I noticed a lot of youtube videos Ive watched recently had moments where there probably shouldve been epilepsy warnings

p2p2xb,t5_2syer,I dont recall when I started exhibiting pains in my foot and dont recall if they were always in the same area
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,may have been the big toe once
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,but for the most part they have occurred in both feet
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,I may go a year without issue or get - a year
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,where my feet swell up and its painful to put any weight on it
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,Ive gone to a rheumatologist who says Im a likely candidate for gout using a point system where certain factors give a total that says you either have gout or dont
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,and I happened to land right in between
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,He wanted to do a blood test the next time I had an issue
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,but getting to him during an attack is pretty difficult due to location so Ive been icing and relaxing it away until my recent pain in my right foot
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,I had seen a podiatrist for something else recently and decided to go back since I had mentioned possible gout during that visit and she had said to come by if I do experience it
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,Without taking any blood samples she proceeded with an x-ray and putting pressure on certain areas of my foot to see where the pain was coming from
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,she didnt think it was gout and said it was most likely the tendon
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,next to the big toe being overworked causing the inflammation
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,she did give me an injection to bring down the swelling and I was good for a day until the meds wore off and my foot started to swell again last night
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,this morning the swelling has gone done a lot almost to what it was during the meds
p2p2xb,t5_2syer,was the podiatrist right in that it most likely isnt gout or should I look for a third opinion on the matter
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,Ive been on  mg Keppra for years and everything has been mostly stable
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,except for my moods
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,My mood has driven people away and kept me from closing the deals on many relationships
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,so im going to try to switch over to Briviact
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,when switching meds
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,I had some CRAZY side effects
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,What experiences do yall have with starting your new prescription of Briviact and is there anything I should be on the lookout for
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,What can I expect
rdkiov,t5_2s1h9,Im hoping all goes smoothly and it leaves me in a better mental state with the same if not better stability
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,lots of mucus in stool and mucus incontinence
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,is this ibs
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,For about  years now Ive been dealing with some gut-related issues
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,but by far the most weird one is the fact that my stool is accompanied with a lot of mucus like half a cup or  ml a day
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,Sometimes when I feel the urge to go for number two
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,the only thing that comes out is the mucus and I even have mucus coming out of my ass while going about my day
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,The latter results in a lot of shame for me and makes it hard to go outside without being anxious about it happening again it literally feels like Im shitting myself in public
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,I also have frequent stomach  belly aches some of them can only be relieved by laying down
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,bloating and nausea I barely ever vomit though
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,my stool is inconsistent and I often feel like I have to go to the toilet
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,but nothing happens
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,The excessive pushing has caused hemmorhoids
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,I dont know if this is important information
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,but the stomach cramps during my period are unbearable as well I have to take  paracetamol a day and still cant function
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,Ive been to a bunch of doctors and they have done a lot of bloodtests
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,Besides that Ive had an ultrasound of my stomach
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,but they didnt find anything
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,I have been diagnosed with IBS irritable bowel syndrome
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,depression and retrograde crycopharengeus dysfunction also known as R-CPD or no-burp
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,The IBS diagnosis however was done before my no-burp diagnosis and my R-CPD specialist questioned whether I had both or just no-burp
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,Ive had a procedure for no-burp in october 
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,but I feel like it hasnt worked because of a case of bronchitis just a week after the botox-injection I ll have a follow up coming month
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,Does anyone have a clue if all of this could be explained by my currents diagnosiss
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,Because I feel like theres something more to it
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,Thanks in advance
sopbvg,t5_2s3g1,sertraline  mg for depression

sme6gq,t5_2saq9,Ive noticed that since Ive started taking it that Ive put on at least  lbs and I put it on pretty quickly
sme6gq,t5_2saq9,Has anyone else experienced this

rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,Epilepsy and autism and just a general rant to get this off my chest I know this question has probably been asked a number of times before
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,but heres my situation sorry for the story-mode
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,My son was  when he had his first seizure at the beginning of Covid
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,He was able to speak
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,definitely saw his personality coming into focus
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,He was initially diagnosed with tonicclonic and was put on Keppra
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,Then came the Keppra rage B vitamins worked wonders along with also other seizures appearing absence
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,Our neurologist added clobazam Onfi which helped
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,but did not stop all the seizures from happening
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,He was diagnosed with either MAE Doose or LGS
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,still too early to tell at this point
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,The only thing for certain was that he was disappearing
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,we were able to get the seizures to completely subside by going on a modified Atkins diet
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,At  he started school
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,where the state diagnosed him on the autism spectrum
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,This diagnosis was helpful
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,as it got him a number of addl services to help him speech
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,We did see some progression
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,Bring to get a  year old to maintain a strict-diet is nearly impossible
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,and the seizures came back in full force some new ones too and have started occurring during his sleep
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,After  different hospital visits over the course of  months
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,we started him on Epidiolex reserved for those with LGS
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,and added yet another medication recently Vimpat
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,While the seizures have not fully subsided
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,the severity is much less shorter than a min
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,and at most - times in a day
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,Were on day  with no seizures
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,but that may just be the honeymoon period he gets with new meds
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,Were now on a low glycemic diet
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,and hes finally hay and eating   Our neurologist stated we should get a second opinion as she was out of options she was actually our nd opinion
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,and have spoken to another neurologist who will be seeing him win the next few months
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,She mentioned VNS as a possible direction to go
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,but wont truly know until after more tests
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,Throughout all of this  years come Jan
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,we have lost our son
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,I know we have to keep on trying
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,and we do 
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,but it is hard
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,I had hoped we only lost him for a little bit
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,but that kind of thinking gets further and further away from me as time passes
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,thanks for listening
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,As for my question
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,I always wondered whether all the medication may be muddling his mind
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,and maybe theres hope that if we can FINALLY stop the seizures
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,or get them under control somehow
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,maybe hes not autistic
rfy54u,t5_2s1h9,I dont know if Im just deluding myself for some kind of good news that will never happen

qd156m,t5_2syer,I got Oboz Sawtooth  from Rei
qd156m,t5_2syer,and it keeps my foot safe from the rocks pushing into my gout joint
qd156m,t5_2syer,No flare

qt1f1c,t5_2r876,Question for CF sufferers with children in nurserypre-school Hey all
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,My yr old son goes to nursery once a week on Mondays and has probably had every known strain of cold virus throughout his  months there
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,Hes pretty much got a new one every week come the Thursday
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,I know this is all very normal for a kid in nursery
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,but the issue Im having is that hes passing them all on to me and its really taking its toll on me when they inevitably end up on my chest and I just cant shift it
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,Ive had two courses of orals and two lots of IVs one inpatient
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,one home in  months
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,Ive never been this reliant on antibiotics and Im finding that Im struggling to recover properly afterwards
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,Im worried the little snot machine is going to kill me off
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,Anyone been in a similar situation and have any advice
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,my son is Autistic non-verbal and cant understand commands
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,so cover your sneezes
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,and dont wipe that on me
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,fall on deaf ears
qt1f1c,t5_2r876,He doesnt have CF
stjc31,t5_2saq9,I quit caffeine and I feel  better hope this helps anyone here I was extremely addicted to caffeine for years and was always chasing more to help give me more energy relief from POTS symptoms
stjc31,t5_2saq9,I had no idea how much worse it was making my symptoms
stjc31,t5_2saq9,I had covid for the second time  weeks ago and had no caffeine for that week I had symptoms
stjc31,t5_2saq9,Once I recovered from covid and felt better around a week I wanted to take my caffeine experiment and just not drink it again since I missed all the withdrawl symptoms being sick
stjc31,t5_2saq9,I seriously feel better than I have in YEARS
stjc31,t5_2saq9,I realize now how badly all the caffeine was effecting me
stjc31,t5_2saq9,The withdrawl will take - days but after that
stjc31,t5_2saq9,you will start to feel normal
stjc31,t5_2saq9,Now  weeks out I have more energy than ive had in years  It also is helping so much with the exercise intolerance to be caffeine free and not in a constant state of minor caffeine withdrawl and horrible racing heart anxiety symptoms
ribz7k,t5_2syer,Second Bad Flare Up First Time Using Colchicine Hey guys
ribz7k,t5_2syer,so its been a few months now since my first gout attack
ribz7k,t5_2syer,Those who replied to that post were extremely helpful so Im turning to yall again
ribz7k,t5_2syer,So a couple days ago I started feeling some discomfort in my foot and so as per my doctors recommendation
ribz7k,t5_2syer,I took an Aleve which helped throughout the day
ribz7k,t5_2syer,The next morning
ribz7k,t5_2syer,the pain had returned
ribz7k,t5_2syer,Granted not as bad as before but still not great
ribz7k,t5_2syer,So another Aleve
ribz7k,t5_2syer,relief and then sleep
ribz7k,t5_2syer,Today I woke up and the same thing
ribz7k,t5_2syer,So I figure now that the Aleve didnt really get rid of the crystals at all it just alleviated the pain
ribz7k,t5_2syer,Earlier this evening I picked up a prescription of Colchicine and my rheumatologist told me its good to use when I first feel the flare up happening
ribz7k,t5_2syer,So would the Colchicine not do me any good now that its been a few days into the attack
ribz7k,t5_2syer,Should I stick to the Aleve to keep the pain off
ribz7k,t5_2syer,Any tips would be much appreciated

s7k3hq,t5_2saq9,How do I advocate for myself at the doctors
s7k3hq,t5_2saq9,So I f suspect I may have POTS as I have nearly all of the symptoms and they have been there fluctuating in intensity since I was 
s7k3hq,t5_2saq9,I was able to try convince myself that it was all in my head on the good days but its finally gotten to the point where I cant bear it anymore and my quality of life has deteriorated enough that Ive become suicidal and am barely holding myself together Im getting help for it
s7k3hq,t5_2saq9,Im about to have a doctors appointment to discuss these concerns but I dont know how to properly stand up for myself when they most likely dismiss all of my symptoms like they have over the years
s7k3hq,t5_2saq9,Does anyone have advice for how they pursued a diagnosis

s1kvvt,t5_2tyg2,what is it

s1kvvt,t5_2tyg2,This is a really bad way of explaining it
s1kvvt,t5_2tyg2,so Ill give you an example instead I was walking on the platform at the train station and I suddenly got this really frightening realisation that my body was under the train on the tracks
s1kvvt,t5_2tyg2,This is despite me physically being safe

ssujm4,t5_2syer,One article says cherry juice helps lower uric acid
ssujm4,t5_2syer,another study says it does nothing

qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,She didnt believe it was a true positive since I live day to day pretty normal
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,I have massive joint pain daily and the cold hurts SO BAD but she was dead set on me not having lupus
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,She ran a whole slew of tests on me
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,and I have been anxiously waiting
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,Maybe it was all in my head
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,I kept thinking
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,TODAY MY ANA SCREEN CAME BACK POSITIVE AGAIN AND IT IS HOMOGENEOUS PATTERN OF SLE
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,I am so fucking happy
qcfy3v,t5_2rtve,cried and laughed

rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I want to get rid of it Hi
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,My GERD story started with gastroenteritis almost  months ago
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,After eating something not good for me I remember it was a prepared meal I unfrozened and felt bad after it
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,Just had diarrhea
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,vomiting and heartburn for  weeks no reflux and decided to go to the doctor where he told me I had a gastritis and gave me PPI and anti-diarrhea
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,After taking the PPI esomeprazole I had this feeling of nausea everyday but no more heartburn
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I also had the sensation of water stuck in my throat when I drink
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I thought that was a secondary effect I read it
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,nausea and just thought when I stop PPI this would stop
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I stopped PPI the first month but felt a big rebound effect the following night
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I felt my esophagus totally burning for almost  days and took PPI again for a month
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,But this feeling of nausea and water stuck didnt stop and now always feeling this thing in my throat
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I had endoscopy which was not alarming just a bad position of cardia the thing between stomach and esophagus
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,no helicobacter pylori
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,Why now when I lay down and try to sleep I feel this liquid in my esophagus and this weird sensation in my throat
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa, or  hours after my meal I start to feel this liquid going up
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,PPI seems not to work on this feeling
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,Just few heartburns now but this feeling is here everyday and I dont know what to do to stop it
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,It seems to get better when I dont drink coffee but not sure
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I stopped smoking  months ago way before feeling these weird symptoms
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,I tried now to stop lactose and gluten
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,its been almost  weeks and nothing seems to change
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,Do you think its GERD
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,In your opinion
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,why this happened suddenly after this gastroenteritis
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,Do you have same symptoms and how can I help myself
rh6rpz,t5_2qlaa,Thank you and sorry for my bad English

spy2th,t5_2tyg2,App to support diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Hello everyone
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,I am doing a post graduation and I need to present an ideia of an innovative solution to clinicians
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,I am only a biomedicine PhD student
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,therefore I now little about this topic
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,Since I am working on finding biomarkers I understand that sometimes is difficult to address the diagnosis after the first episode
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,if I created an app were I could fill in symptoms between appointments
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,were you could track how your patients feel
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,what do you find to be useful to support your diagnosis
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,And treatment adjustment
spy2th,t5_2tyg2,I am looking for suggestions of features that you would like to integrate in the app  Thank you in advance
s0ub4y,t5_2tyg2,Embarrassing to tell providers about beliefsstrange actions
s0ub4y,t5_2tyg2,Does anyone else get super embarrassed talking about their symptoms
s0ub4y,t5_2tyg2,I usually have enough insight to know that what Im describing is weird
s0ub4y,t5_2tyg2,and I always leave therapy appts feeling very embarrassed
ri09v3,t5_2syer,Sticky post and protocol on this sub Im sad to say that I need to step back from this sub for a while
ri09v3,t5_2syer,There are some dangerous practices here from specific users
ri09v3,t5_2syer,The mod announcement at the top states Its not ok to diagnose someone
ri09v3,t5_2syer,This isnt really being followed as often
ri09v3,t5_2syer,medical advice is being given
ri09v3,t5_2syer,in particular users are telling people that their doctors are wrong
ri09v3,t5_2syer,This crosses a line
ri09v3,t5_2syer,If they just said something like perhaps consider XXX or I found that YYYY would at least frame this less dangerously
ri09v3,t5_2syer,statements that are not unanimously supported by research are being dictated as fact
ri09v3,t5_2syer,This is all seems to be based on the Edwards AMA
ri09v3,t5_2syer,which perhaps is valuable general information
ri09v3,t5_2syer,is definitely being stretched and weaponized
ri09v3,t5_2syer,This is one doctors comments in a reddit thread
ri09v3,t5_2syer,not a medical exam
ri09v3,t5_2syer,I doubt even Dr
ri09v3,t5_2syer,Edwards would encourage this
ri09v3,t5_2syer,Perhaps Im wrong
ri09v3,t5_2syer,there are some dangerous doctors out there who over simplify things I say this not to accuse Dr
ri09v3,t5_2syer,I know nothing about the person or his practice
ri09v3,t5_2syer,Anyone questioning what a few users peddle as their conventional wisdom are being treated as combative when they ask for sources
ri09v3,t5_2syer,arent swayed by quotes from the AMA
ri09v3,t5_2syer,or simply try to get people here who arent experts to frame their comments as personal opinions i
ri09v3,t5_2syer,to not diagnose and not give medical advice
ri09v3,t5_2syer,Some are treating their personal cases as the norm for everyone
ri09v3,t5_2syer,this community is dangerous and pushing new sufferers away
ri09v3,t5_2syer,I ask the moderators to seriously think about what culture they want on this sub
ri09v3,t5_2syer,The sticky shows in the past
ri09v3,t5_2syer,theyve had problems with people diagnosing via comments
ri09v3,t5_2syer,This practice is still here in full force and left unchecked
ri09v3,t5_2syer,if you find it combative to be asked for sources for claims
ri09v3,t5_2syer,then dont make them
ri09v3,t5_2syer,There is so much misinformation and to oversimplify a complex personal disease such as this one only makes fun of the honest suffers who come here for help
ri09v3,t5_2syer,Youre not a hero
ri09v3,t5_2syer,youre not a rhumatologist
ri09v3,t5_2syer,you cant apply some comments from an AMA to every situation
ri09v3,t5_2syer,You have made this community more toxic by not acting with some humility
ri09v3,t5_2syer,and likely have genuinely hurt real people
ri09v3,t5_2syer,Im sorry to see people treat this as their personal playground
ri09v3,t5_2syer,It has driven at least this user
ri09v3,t5_2syer,and possibly many others
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,Thought broadcasting with tethered familiar voices Currently fighting with the delusion that everyone within a large radius can hear my thoughts accompanied by the fact that I hear familiar voices of neighbors an ex who stalked me
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,It started about - months after this post and reading around different boards on Reddit  Ive found several others with similar experiences
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,At first it had started suddenly with believing I was hearing my neighbors having conversations about me ie watching through my windows and later on I had made the connection that it was a female coworker and an actual neighbor
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,Later came to believe that my voice was unnaturally loud and I would converse with them
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,This later progressed as I had switched jobs and it developed from supernaturally loud voice to everyone can hear your thoughtstelepathy which has been a debilitating delusion as I keep going back and forth arguing with the now hostile and growing number of stalkers neighbors
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,As to the dialogue conversations its mostly just trying to convince me to come over to the house I believe the voices are coming from then berating and punishment for not doing so
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,Ive tried reality testing by texting the people I thought I was hearing with negative results
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,The voices are still persistent and as I write this post look up similar experiences Im being berated for it as they continue to tell me to just come out or you know what house it is
rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,Honestly just looking for people who have had similar experiences or any kind of help which would be greatly appreciated

suaswq,t5_2s3g1,and lately its been really bad with sitting in my office chair
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,It hurts if I lay on my right side too long
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,Im constantly worried itll get worse or that its my gallbladder or liver
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,I already had a liver biopsy
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,all the scans and testing you can get for pancreas
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,Yet Im still worried

suaswq,t5_2s3g1,I do have IBS-D
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,My doctor told me she would bet money it was my IBS
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,It also radiates to my back and I do get lower right side pain as well
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,Ive thought it could be endometriosis
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,muscular wall injury
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,I guess it could just be my IBS
suaswq,t5_2s3g1,But can IBS pain be positional

swybs8,t5_2s23e,MS or My Significant Other Jolie and Renault are looking forward to the upcoming fourth anniversary of their first date
swybs8,t5_2s23e,it is ten days to Valentines and Renault is making a reservation with a fancy restaurant and already thinks about what he will be wearing
swybs8,t5_2s23e,He feels so lucky to have something like this to look forward to
swybs8,t5_2s23e,They are certainly very much in love and it appears as if they will
swybs8,t5_2s23e,stay this way
swybs8,t5_2s23e,  It will be four years
swybs8,t5_2s23e,for me as well
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Four years since the diagnosis
swybs8,t5_2s23e,I made a reservation for Valentines with my neurologist
swybs8,t5_2s23e,to spend half the day hooked to an intravenous drip
swybs8,t5_2s23e,as I have to be twice a year
swybs8,t5_2s23e,When I made the appointment
swybs8,t5_2s23e,I didnt even notice that they gave me February 
swybs8,t5_2s23e,but now that I think about it
swybs8,t5_2s23e,I guess I do wonder what Ill be wearing
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Just like Renault
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Each day when Renault wakes up next to Jolie
swybs8,t5_2s23e,she is the first thing he sees and the first thing he thinks about
swybs8,t5_2s23e,He tries to think of ways to make her happy throughout the day
swybs8,t5_2s23e,small things like preparing her café au lait the way she likes it
swybs8,t5_2s23e,cuddling close to her while she wakes up
swybs8,t5_2s23e,going downstairs for the paper with her favourite cross-words
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Jolie is somewhat grumpy and unusually rough
swybs8,t5_2s23e,He doesnt know why and so he is simply extra careful throughout the day
swybs8,t5_2s23e,whenever he goes to bed
swybs8,t5_2s23e,his last thought is of her as well
swybs8,t5_2s23e,How will she feel tomorrow
swybs8,t5_2s23e,The fact is his happiness
swybs8,t5_2s23e,his lightheartedness they do depend on her mood and well-being
swybs8,t5_2s23e,  Whenever I wake up
swybs8,t5_2s23e,the first thing I do is to actually feel my legs
swybs8,t5_2s23e,How are they doing today
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Stretching and probing
swybs8,t5_2s23e,gently rubbing at sore muscles
swybs8,t5_2s23e,In my mind I go through the day ahead of me and already plan where do I need to walk
swybs8,t5_2s23e,when can I get some minutes of sitting in between
swybs8,t5_2s23e,where do I have to stand for some time
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Will today be a good or a bad day
swybs8,t5_2s23e,As with Jolie
swybs8,t5_2s23e,it is not always clear to me at first but the mood of this disease shifts rather unpredictably
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Each day when I go to bed
swybs8,t5_2s23e,clumsily shift my legs beneath the sheets
swybs8,t5_2s23e,and turn off the lights
swybs8,t5_2s23e,I can not help but wonder about the next day
swybs8,t5_2s23e,and hope for a good one
swybs8,t5_2s23e,You might say Jolie is a rather demanding girlfriend
swybs8,t5_2s23e,She lays claim to Renaults attention several times each day
swybs8,t5_2s23e,She texts him when he is at work
swybs8,t5_2s23e,when he is on his lunch-break
swybs8,t5_2s23e,in the after-noon and if they ever slept apart she would unfailingly text him at night
swybs8,t5_2s23e,But they dont
swybs8,t5_2s23e,They do not ever sleep apart anymore
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Renault loved this at first
swybs8,t5_2s23e,He felt like he must be worth a lot
swybs8,t5_2s23e,if Jolie wonderful Jolie wanted not ever to be apart
swybs8,t5_2s23e,he is starting to reconsider
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Her demands are getting stifling and maybe even a bit frightening
swybs8,t5_2s23e,These worries accompany him through his days now and of course
swybs8,t5_2s23e,wherever he goes
swybs8,t5_2s23e,shes never far from his mind
swybs8,t5_2s23e,I have never been glad about the knowledge or the prospects
swybs8,t5_2s23e,that there was a time when I still had some glimmer of hope
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Hope for a very mild development
swybs8,t5_2s23e,hope for improvement even
swybs8,t5_2s23e,hope when thinking about tomorrow
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Every day when I am at work I take some medication
swybs8,t5_2s23e,because the disease demands it
swybs8,t5_2s23e,I take it in the lunch-break again
swybs8,t5_2s23e,I take a lot before I go to sleep
swybs8,t5_2s23e,And wherever I go
swybs8,t5_2s23e,its neigh the only thing I can think about anymore
swybs8,t5_2s23e,Because I have to concentrate so damn hard just to stumble where I want to go because I need to beware that I dont fall
swybs8,t5_2s23e,while Renault might or might not take this Valentines as a good opportunity to tell Jolie about his thoughts
swybs8,t5_2s23e,his fears and worries
swybs8,t5_2s23e,and thus set in motion a chain of serious talks
swybs8,t5_2s23e,possible approaches and so on
swybs8,t5_2s23e,with the aim of molding their relationship to their mutual needs

rsvho1,t5_2s1h9,Did any of you have a pineal gland cyst on your MRI
rsvho1,t5_2s1h9,My MRI showed a mm pineal gland cyst
rsvho1,t5_2s1h9,for reference the pineal gland is mm on average
rsvho1,t5_2s1h9,My neurologist was telling me typically these are ignored as clinically insignificant
rsvho1,t5_2s1h9,but he also mentioned a doctor who has been removing them to great success with his patients symptoms
rsvho1,t5_2s1h9,Curious if many of us have this cyst or abnormality and its being disregarded

sdz98z,t5_2tyg2,What drugs can you still take when your on antipsychotics So I have to take Risperidone mg a day I wonder what kind of drugs would still have an effect on me
sdz98z,t5_2tyg2,Can I still drink alcohol or use amphetamines
sdz98z,t5_2tyg2,My psychosis got triggered after a bad breakup with someone that has bpd that fucked me up very bad and didnt let me sleep for days but I was also on ghb which wont keep you awake as long as I did on its own but it was still called drug induced psychosis even though my psychosis wasnt directly induced by drugs
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,Depakote Valproic acid reduced libido sex drive I have been using depakote chrono now for a few weeks and noticed a few side effects  dry mouth
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,slowness and most importantly a greatly reduced libido or lack of interest in sex
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,Plus its really hard to reach an orgasm
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,There are some great positives too with this medication
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,Having talked to my doc
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,he tries to switch me to Vimpat lacosamide
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,after reading the info on that medication it seems to be used for partial seizures and not the tonic clonic that i have on very irregular intervals
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,Anyone here have similar experiences with depakote  depakine
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,Any others on vimpat for tonic-clonic maybe
rupse8,t5_2s1h9,Its really hard to find info online for this kind of situation
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,this is my first Reddit post and Im typing this because even though I got diagnosed with GERD by a doctor
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,I wanted to be sure
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa, days ago
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,I started getting a random dry cough
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,It eventually progressed into where my throat would feel irritated inflamed and I would feel mucus lodged in my throat that led to me constantly clearing it and irritating it more
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,thus inducing a cough
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,Now for two years
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,Ive been having constant belching
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,stomach discomfort after Ive eaten and when I belch I would feel relief
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,Now I thought it was a throat infection but after the doctor checked my throat
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,everything seemed to be fine so she told me to change my lifestyle and prescribed me pantecta
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,Ive been taking it seven days now with the lifestyle changes and my symptoms arent easing up
rhtveu,t5_2qlaa,What should I do
rxapbo,t5_2tyg2,Cant tell if my experiences are real or psychosis Basically exactly what the title says
rxapbo,t5_2tyg2,I hear noises and doors opening late at night when others are sleeping and objects have been moved or fallen by themselves sometimes in my room but Im not sure if its real or if Im losing my mind

rlktv6,t5_2syer, F suffering from the worst flare up yet Ive had episodes for about 
rlktv6,t5_2syer,- years but no recent flares for over a year
rlktv6,t5_2syer,I get it in my elbow thankfully
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Cant imagine it in my feet
rlktv6,t5_2syer,I was literally sitting In a restaurant with my family a minute ago and could feel the sweet relief of a portion of it flowing away from my elbow
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Has anyone felt an immediate relief like that before
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Its still swollen on the other side of my arm but Im considerably more comfortable now
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Also any other female in here
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Edit for update So things have changed since I made this post
rlktv6,t5_2syer,I wound up in the er
rlktv6,t5_2syer,The pain and swelling reached down to my hand and up my arm pit pituitary glands
rlktv6,t5_2syer,The er doc said not gout but bursitis
rlktv6,t5_2syer,I told him how my GP always said gout
rlktv6,t5_2syer,but not that it happens often enough to investigate further
rlktv6,t5_2syer,He said not this time
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Its bursitis that also developed into a skin infection
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Im on antibacterial meds that are slowly reducing the pain and swelling
rlktv6,t5_2syer,So two different diagnosis
rlktv6,t5_2syer,Next time I get a flare I will just head to a rheumatologist
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,Melatonin vs Immunosuppressants According to Mayo Clinic
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,melatonin can stimulate immune function and interfere with immunosuppressive therapy
si6ag1,t5_2s23e, As someone whos been on melatonin for years on end and on Ocrevus for a couple of years
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,I find this concerning
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,Insufficientpoor quality sleep isnt good
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,and long-term use of diphenhydramine isnt recommended
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,so holy expletive
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,I dont know if the dosage I take mg time-release is sufficient to cause interference and I know that there are yeasayers and naysayers regarding melatonin for MS patients
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,but I dont know if the pros are for those on immunosuppressants
si6ag1,t5_2s23e,If I were doing swimmingly

rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,Auras Inquiry So I am in the process of finding a new neuro and need to go over all sorts of things I had in my life as I prepare for this new one one day
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,I am stating to reflect on different things and I am beginning to remember this one thing that used to happen to me as a  kid
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,and even as an adult
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,which does not happen to me anymore now that I am older and on keppra
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,  When I was a kid and I would get sick
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,either flu or something else
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,I used to get this thing and feeling that I was outside my body
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,Its very hard to describe but it sort of felt like I was in a very very large room
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,a cathedral or something
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,and I was outside of myself looking down at my body from the very furthest top corner of the large room
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,It was a feeling like I was a little fly sitting in the top corner of the large cathedral and looking down at myself lying in the bed sick
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,I am starting to wonder whether that was seizures or auras
rfix0f,t5_2s1h9,I dont get that anymore

sai8d9,t5_2s23e,Got th Covid vaccine today Hello everybody
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,Just wanted to let everyone know Im roughly  months out from getting my third additional dose of the Covid vaccine in August 
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,so I got my th dose today
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,This th shot is technically considered an actual booster since three shots is now considered to be a primary vaccine series for immunocompromisedimmunosuppressed people Source httpswww
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,html  I scheduled my th dose a few weeks ago for today
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,so the process was pretty easy in terms of getting a shot
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,Vaccine demand is pretty high right now because of omicron
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,but its not impossible to get an appointment
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,I have gotten sick from pretty much every other dose of the Pfizer vaccine Ive gotten
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,so I expect to be run down with a fever etc
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,Its nothing Tylenol cant manage
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,Im feeling pretty much fine today other than a sore arm
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,If youre thinking about getting a th dose
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,I highly recommend it to boost your protection
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,Even if youre on a B cell depleter
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,T cell response most likely will increase again with a booster
sai8d9,t5_2s23e,Stay safe everyone

ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,Famotidinepepcid does not work
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,According to my doctor I probably have silent or acid reflux
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,He came to this conclusion because I burp air a lot
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,And yeah my throat does hurt and I do taste something weird
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,My throat also tickles sometimes
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,and sometimes it feels like air or something goes up
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,Not even sure how to describe that sensation
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,but its frightening
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,So he prescribed  weeks of FamotidinePepcid
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,twice a day
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,Its been  weeks
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,but so far Im still burping
ryj23a,t5_2qlaa,How long will it take for Famotidine to actually work

seg310,t5_2tyg2,just went thru my worst episode yet
seg310,t5_2tyg2,Smoked some weed and thought everyone were demons trying to kill me
seg310,t5_2tyg2,It got to a point where I was outside with a shattered cup as a weapon trying to defend myself from my friends
seg310,t5_2tyg2,I destroyed my friends house out of anger and fear
seg310,t5_2tyg2,I wanted to use my chain as a weapon
seg310,t5_2tyg2,I took out my gauges because I thought they were torture devices
seg310,t5_2tyg2,After I was pinned down I felt that I was sold to the people that had me pinned
seg310,t5_2tyg2,and that my friend that was walking away sold me to them
seg310,t5_2tyg2,Long story short I fucked up
seg310,t5_2tyg2,Tried explaining this to my family and they dont seem to understand the fear that this episode brought me
seg310,t5_2tyg2,Its the first physical episode Ive had
seg310,t5_2tyg2,Im afraid that everyone around me are fake and I just need some reassurance man
seg310,t5_2tyg2,Thanks for reading
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,Advice needed Do I need to see a doctor
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,Ive had gerd on and off once per week mostly since a few months now
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,I was trying to resolve it by cutting off bad habits
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,eating papaya etc
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,Or I was just having having a pill rabeloc mg when it was bad
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,I could last about  days without reflux
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,Then recently I noticed powder milk with cereal weetabix is acting as a trigger
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,something Ive never had before and I use to have milk every morning
s1ajxb,t5_2qlaa,Should I now consider seeing a doctor for ongoing treatment
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,Advice on considering dropping medicine Hi all
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I have had MS for maybe  years and never got an attack since the first one that brought the diagnose
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I have been incredibly lucky and dont feel much
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,from time to time a foot that might buzz a little
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,some of you have probably tried that
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I feel super healthy
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,can run k etc
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,but I feel I get sick pretty frequently during the winter season
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,which is pretty annoyning
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I figured it might have something to do with the fact that I do take immunosuppressive medicine AubagioTeriflunomide I dont feel any side effects from the small pill
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,but what if I stopped taking it
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I know no one can tell me what will happen
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,maybe the medicine is the reason why I am not getting any attacks etc
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,but maybe some of you have been in a similar situation
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,Has anyone you know stopped taking medicine
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,and would there be any good reason to think I might get less sick during winter
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I usually get these small flu-like situations
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,where I feel pretty bad like something is coming up and then it pretty quickly goes away
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,Or a sore throat or something similar I often get these at least  times during the winter season from memory
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I guess a hybrid model could also be considered
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,where I simply only took the medicine for the warmest  months of the year
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I live in Scandinavia
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,so weather is not great usually
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,Thanks for the support from such an awesome community
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,would appreciate any feedback on any of this
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,I did try talking to my doctor about this
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,he simply said we dont recommend this -no big surprise there to be honest -
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,Edit So many helpful comments warning me not to stop taking medicine
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,and also trying to talk to my doctor about all these minor flus I keep getting
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,Ill definitely listen to your advice
st7vyj,t5_2s23e,thanks and all the best

rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,Im so tired of side effects of medication and confusion I feel like this is really getting in the way of living my life normally
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,Every morning I wake up shaking and its a total crapshoot on if my interactions with the world around me feel foreign
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,If I feel off
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,I feel the need to call off to work
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,since i do not want to be a danger to me or anyone else on the road
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,I had to call in today first day back of the new year because these symptoms were particularly bad
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,I just want to live more normally
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,Even with FMLA Im terrified to lose my job over randomly calling in
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,I need this job to support my daughter
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,Every medication Ive tried seems to throw me off in their own way
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,ive not had a gran mal for a year now but the other issues feel like their just degrading my quality of life
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,and worries me greatly for the future
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,It takes forever for me to see my neurologist
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,and he is always hesitant to change my medication
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,as he wants to see if side effects subside guess what
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,they dont im at a loss as to how to feel like I can be a normal person
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,its frankly very worrying and at times makes me feel hopeless
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,Does anyone else feel helpless
rvyulo,t5_2s1h9,I sincerely hope we can all get to a point where we feel more in control

pcpzla,t5_2r876,CF and side effects of Trikafta kids in particular My yo son has mild CF some dry cough
pcpzla,t5_2r876,slightly lower lung function and definitely pancreas issues
pcpzla,t5_2r876,but no hospitalizations or infections currently
pcpzla,t5_2r876,We are starting school this next week while also starting Trikafta
pcpzla,t5_2r876,and Im wondering if anyone can tell me whether kids experience the same side effects with the same severity as adults
pcpzla,t5_2r876,So if you have kids on Trikafta
pcpzla,t5_2r876,what did you notice
pcpzla,t5_2r876,Weve let the school know that some of the side effects might masquerade as symptoms of Covid
pcpzla,t5_2r876,but was it severe enough that we might need to keep him home
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,Is this psychosis or something else
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,I know this person that started having common delusions such as conspiracy theories
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,links to famous people etc  got treated with lithium for a couple months and they mostly went away BUT now he just acts weird
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,I know some is due to anhedonia and that he is still recovering but he also says or does super random things for example  playing Indian traditional music loudly and dancing to it  sending texts writing with vocabulary from another country  Staring at people having a conversation
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,he would just sit there and stare as if watching a TV show and dont talk unless adressed asking random questions like who was the first person to carry me as a baby
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,Have you pooped today already
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,What happen to your childhood friend
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,Remember when we went to europe
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,And when asked why he asks that he just says  oh its nothing or just wanted to know   obsesion with numbers and dates
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,repeats when were people born
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,asks a specific date when something happened
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,writes numbers in a journal
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,says number  doesnt exist
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,etc laughs randomly at unfunny situations like watching a comercial or watching someones picture on his phone  destroying or damaging his documents like passport
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,birth certificate   Is this still psychosis
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,Honestly sometimes it feels like hes just playing with us acting very random to have fun or confuse us
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,when he was full psychotic we could see it in eyes he was having an event but now he can be completely normal and then say something really out of context
sckvbs,t5_2tyg2,im sure it might be part of the recovery process Hes got much better from last year and  of the time hes fine but when he gets super random we dont know what to say or how to treat him

ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,Was this a focal seizure
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,I am terrible at describing things and my stories tend to drag so Im sorry ahead of time
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,The other day I was driving my car
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,and I was with my boyfriend
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,We were coming out of our neighborhood and there was some more traffic than usual
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,Mind that I am still kind of new to manual driving but am capable and feel comfortable doing it my brain just blanked
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,like completely while I was driving and putting it into its gears
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,Its like all of the sudden my brain glitched and it wouldnt stop
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,I was panicking bc
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,well obviously Im driving
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,but at the same time my brain feels like its stopping and starting and stopping and starting multiple times
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,Its like when a song plays on the radio but the signal is cutting out lol thats the best way I can describe it
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,So that went on for a minute and he had me pull over bc he was trying to help me but it was just making me panic more
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,We pulled over and I just instantly broke down in tears
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,It was awful
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,Ive had glitches before and weird moments but Ive never thought about them being actual seizures until this latest one
ry0m8y,t5_2s1h9,I know I twitch when Im stressed or tired but this felt differentif anyone has a similar experience or advice it would be so appreciated

rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Steroids vs Colchicine Colchicine worked far better for me
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,For years I thought I had a sore and stiff big toe from exercise and hiking
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,After wearing a poor fitting pair of shoes
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,I had my first flare up
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Lasted two months
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Im in my early s
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Went through three rounds of steroids and even a cortisone injection
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,The flare subsided but the soreness and stiffness remained
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Then I felt it getting more sore and stiff
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,My uric acid is high normal
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,but not all that bad
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,My experience with gout is a slow and stubborn pain rather than fast sucker punch
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Knocked it out in a matter of hours
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,for my gout experience
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,colchicine is the way
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Doc said as it was my first flare to use colchicine and see how that works before going on allo
rnn8vv,t5_2syer,Anyway just thought Id share in case it helps someone
rmbhsu,t5_2r876,Prenatal testingtwo different mutationswhat to do
rmbhsu,t5_2r876,We tested prenatal genetic testing and one has the major  delta  gene and the other has a relatively unknown clinical significance gene  mutation
rmbhsu,t5_2r876,Only one case from  published
rmbhsu,t5_2r876,We dont know what to do and genetic counselors honestly cant predict what the phenotype will be if it is that rare  chance both genes are passed on
rmbhsu,t5_2r876,Any advice or anyone have this situation before
sifwpy,t5_2s23e,I want to dance Ive worked so hard to be as positive as I could possibly be since I was diagnosed
sifwpy,t5_2s23e,Id say I did a good job
sifwpy,t5_2s23e,But tonight Im laying in bed absolutely destroyed because I would give anything for my legs to work the way they used to
sifwpy,t5_2s23e,To just dance and be free
sifwpy,t5_2s23e,But they dont work like they used to
sifwpy,t5_2s23e,I cant even run because my legs dont understand the function anymore

ry9h50,t5_2s23e,My father has been on copaxone for  years and has been stable
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,He has not developed any new lesions and has not relapsed since the first attack
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,He already had about  lesions on his brain when he was diagnosed
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,but his symptoms are pretty mild
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,which is a miracle in itself
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,I was recently diagnosed
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,and the doctor recommended three different medications
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,I am making an appointment with her to go over the options and discuss
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,She did not include copaxone on that list
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,Im thinking of asking her about copaxone since its worked so well with my father
ry9h50,t5_2s23e,Wondering if anyone here has experience and opinions on it
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Getting tilt table test done next week
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Has anyone ever passed the test
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,About  months ago my neurologist told me she believes I have pots
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,When she diagnosed me she got me scheduled for a tilt table test to further my diagnosis
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Im worried I may end up passing the test because I have not been experiencing symptoms
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Ever since she diagnosed me
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Ive been on medications and Ive made a lot of lifestyle changes
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Its worked wonders
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,I currently have not had any episodes in over a month and a half
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Ive noticed that when I monitor my blood pressure there hasnt been any major jumps
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Even when Im dizzy
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,my blood pressure barely rises
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,I did tell the doctor Ill be seeing for my test about this and he said there could be a chance I end up passing
s42w3t,t5_2saq9,Has this happened to anyone else
sqmule,t5_2s3g1,Literally Gas pains were made by devils in the hell
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,This sucks Im so over everything about MS
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I had a misdiagnosis in   
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,Finally got the diagnosis and started treatment  years later
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I have had two episodes since the official diagnosis within nine months of each other
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,First it took the vision in one eye
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,now its trying to take my dominate hand
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I left my appointment this week in a panic
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,because the unknown is so scary
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,What is this awful thing going to take from me next
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,Im in my s and feel like Im in my s physically
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I feel like this is impacting my relationship in a negative way
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,and I dont want to lose him
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I think he struggles to realize Im not forgetful because Im ignoring him or dont care
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,Im forgetful because my short term memory isnt that sharp anymore
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,Im really struggling emotionally because no one in my inner circle understands what living with MS is like
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I have a follow up this month to talk about changing treatment
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I dont feel like there is any right answer on what to switch to from Copaxone
sr9mgl,t5_2s23e,I hate this
sqdfc4,t5_2syer,Intense pain in the outside of my foot
sqdfc4,t5_2syer,Sort of around the base of little toe on the side and the top
sqdfc4,t5_2syer,Anyone ever experienced similar
sqdfc4,t5_2syer,I saw a podiatrist who was stumped
sqdfc4,t5_2syer,I was diagnosed with gout about  years ago but am on allopurinol
sqdfc4,t5_2syer,Wouldnt even say the pain is in a joint
sqdfc4,t5_2syer,Considering getting an X-ray
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Switching from trileptal to lamotragine
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Im currently in the process of switching between the two meds so Im doing combo therapy at the moment
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Ive had problems with the high dosage of trileptal giving me effects of double vision
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,which was worsened when my doc put me on lamotragine too I was having insane double vision
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,walking around like drunk
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Im still getting double vision
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,even as the doctor is trying to increase lamotragine and decrease trileptal
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,It seemed to have increased since the last time went from mg trileptal  mg lamotragine to mg trileptal and mg lamotragine
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,The double vision decreased dramatically when he lessened the trileptal to mg but now thats hes increased the lamotragine
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,decreasing the trileptal did tbaoslutely nothing
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,it made it kinda worse to which the double vision lasts longer
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Im tired and sick of this
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Doc says he wants to see me in  months from December but Im considering just nagging him ahead of time bc I cant deal with this
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,especially when school starts up again
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,I just dont want him to be too annoyed with me tho
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Do you guys think it would be possible to completely cut out the trileptal entirely and increase the lamotragine to mg to compensate when I talk with doc
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,Bc right now
rsouiv,t5_2s1h9,the lamotragine is preventing my seizures at least the big ones where I go unconscious
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,What to drink on the go This is a similar post to what I made months ago
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,but Im hoping a new audience might yield new insight
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,Basically
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,everything upsets my stomach
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,even room temperature purified water
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,Tap water is mostly a no go unless Im drinking less than  ml at a time
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,I can drink ginger tea made with purified water
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,but thats not very portable
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,If Im busy at work or need to do something for the holidays
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,I need to find a source of heat to warm up purified water with which to make ginger tea
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,Thats not convenient at all
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,Since I also cant eat fruit
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,it is easy for me to get dehydrated
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,Porridge seems relatively okay
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,If its just a one day flight
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,I can just fast the entire day with no food or water
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,but if my flight gets canceled
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,its not safe for a person to go  days with no food or water due to dehydration
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,In an emergency
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,I can just deal with the upset stomach to stay alive
risqbw,t5_2qlaa,but Id rather find something safer to drink

ov8i5q,t5_2syer,I am a reasonably fit male in my s who had my first bout of gout  years ago and immediately went on mg Allopurinol
ov8i5q,t5_2syer,My research scientist by profession showed that changing my diet wouldnt make a difference
ov8i5q,t5_2syer,and I enjoy my meat and beer too much
ov8i5q,t5_2syer,First thing I did was buy a Uric Acid Meter UASure and monitor my UA levels
ov8i5q,t5_2syer,Before Allo was

slnrpk,t5_2s3g1,Turns out I do have IBS Hey yall  I think I posted in here a while ago asking for advice on how to get better poops
slnrpk,t5_2s3g1,Well Ive recently went to a doctor and it turns out I know why my shit turn to
slnrpk,t5_2s3g1,I had IBS all along
slnrpk,t5_2s3g1,I post this as a success story because after  years of struggling
slnrpk,t5_2s3g1,I finally have an answer to my digestion woes
slnrpk,t5_2s3g1,But that in that I will definitely find this subreddit useful if and when my ibs does flair up
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,how do you handle them both
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,Ive had been diagnosed with PTSD as long as I can remember
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,and Ive had POTS for about a year and a half
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,My POTS is relatively mild compared to other cases Ive seen
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,I watch my salt intake
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,avoid hot showers
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,I drink pedialyte on days I dont feel so hot
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,and I need to sit down a lot
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,but Im still able to work my mostly on my feet job with a few accommodations
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,One thing that feels incredibly debilitating though
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,is when something triggers my PTSD I dont do well with loud noises
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,being grabbed from behind
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,or just surprises in general
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,When that happens
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,my heart rate escalates due to the PTSD
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,and stays high because of POTS
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,It gets hard to breath
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,which makes me hyperventilate
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,which just sends my sympathetic nervous system into over drive and makes both the feeling of initial panic and my heart rate both way worse
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,I ended up laying on the floor of my office for  minutes trying to settle my breathing in order to lower my heart rate while trying to stay conscious
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,Is there a better solution than just
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,making sure I dont get scared
sg7ncf,t5_2saq9,Because right now I just feel like I look like one of the fainting goats
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,Doctors told me my first seizure was because of anxiety
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,turns out is was epilepsy I had my first seizure at  back in November of  and it was a tonic clonic seizure
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,I was very disoriented and confused
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,having no idea what was happening as my boyfriend who was laying in bed next to me was freaking out telling me I had a seizure
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,He had taken me to the closest emergency room
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,which from there I was transported to the hospital for an over-night stay so they could run tests on me
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,My boyfriend had to explain to them what happened as I had no memory of it and I tried to explain to them how I was feeling
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,They gave me an MRI and a EEG test
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,which both came back normal
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,Since I had a past of an anxiety disorder
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,they told me it was just anxiety and discharged me
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,They gave me no referral to see a neurologist
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,gave me no advice
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,and gave me no medication
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,Its just anxiety
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,youre fine and  go speak to your primary doctor is what they told me
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,My primary doctor also did nothing for me except threaten to take my drivers license away
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,Still got no help and they did not mention anything about seeing a neurologist
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,Over the last year
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,I continued to have them
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,My seizures would happen multiple times a week and sometimes even multiple times a day
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,My seizures would cause me to lose consciousness
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,get multiple concussions
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,bite the insides of my mouth
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,temporarily lose my sight  mobility of limbs
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,I know everyone here understands how awful seizures are and how you feel after them
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,Lack of sleep
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,stressetc is what caused my seizures to flare up
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,because they told me it was just anxiety and blew me off
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,I also just blew it off despite how awful it was and all the telling signs that it was something more I feel so stupid for that
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,It took almost a year until I realized I needed to go see a neurologist
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,The neurologist right away diagnosed me with epilepsy and was in shock from how I was treated
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,It makes me so angry I had to go through this
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,and makes me even more angry hearing from others that had similar experiences
rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,Sorry for the long post

rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,Over Thinking Potential Global Supply Issues and Medication I am on a fun mix of Keppra and Zonegram to control my Epilepsy
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,I was only on Keppra until earlier this year as I was still getting breakthrough seizures every - months and so far so good with the extra pile on of chemicals
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,Any way with the fun disruption Covid has had with global supply chains and not to mention what climate change will have in the future and the ever deteriorating global political situation going on this means shipping will only continue to be an issue
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,My main problem is I am in Australia and for the past  odd years we have gladly sniffed the farts of neoliberal capitalism and destroyed any sovereign manufacturing capability so this means there is no real pharmaceutical industry here outside of a few niche things like I know my keppra pills for example are made in Belgium for example and I havent been able to determine where my other ones are made as the box doesnt specify and the information online doesnt clarify from my searching at least
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,My concern is if there is say a fuel shortage
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,another ship going sideways down the Suez
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,my pants on head government pisses China off further and they actually block off shipping in retaliation or do some other aggressive trade blocking actions or some other natural disaster type calamity occurs and this stops my magic pills from coming in
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9, years ago this would have been paranoid but this is sadly becoming too real and I am not sure what my plan B is as I am too reliant on this crap to survive
rft2qh,t5_2s1h9,Anyone else had similar lines of thought out there in the world
sdx0dn,t5_2tyg2,Feeling a bit off Ive been feeling a bit off this evening
sdx0dn,t5_2tyg2,I had to resort to taking a Valium to try and calm myself down a bit
sdx0dn,t5_2tyg2,Im anxious that Im entering into another episode and it scares me
sdx0dn,t5_2tyg2,Does anyone else feel off before going into an episode
sdx0dn,t5_2tyg2,how did you deal with it
sdx0dn,t5_2tyg2,I have no clue what to do apart from taking Valium when I need it or just try to sleep through it
sdx0dn,t5_2tyg2,Edit I am slightly paranoid

pswcl1,t5_2r876,i am very afraid of getting pregnant
pswcl1,t5_2r876,weve always used condoms because theyre easy and accessible
pswcl1,t5_2r876,but recently ive been having lots of utis and irritation caused by them
pswcl1,t5_2r876,im thinking about switching to a different method of birth control but im wondering if its even worth it
pswcl1,t5_2r876,i know hes infertile
pswcl1,t5_2r876,but im so afraid of getting pregnant
pswcl1,t5_2r876,id like to use birth control for my peace of mind but on the other hand i dont want to deal with side effects and stuff for nothing

r3ixtn,t5_2syer,Im curious if anyone has noticed a difference in their UA in different fingers
r3ixtn,t5_2syer,I dont have enough data  myself and its too damn expensive to really launch a definitive experiment
r3ixtn,t5_2syer,It just seems that when I use my index or middle finger I get higher readings than when I use my pinky or ring
r3ixtn,t5_2syer,I prefer to use the lesser fingers because I play guitar and they are less calloused
r3ixtn,t5_2syer,Totally inconclusive at this point
r3ixtn,t5_2syer,just wondering if anyone else has noticed a difference

shd015,t5_2s23e,When Im  I can already say that I have ms since  YEARS
shd015,t5_2s23e,I met a young guy today who told me that he also has a chronic disease since  years
shd015,t5_2s23e,A bit later I found out that he was  and has the disease since 
shd015,t5_2s23e,I was surprised that at a young age like that
shd015,t5_2s23e,he could already say that he has it since  years

rpdu90,t5_2qlaa,no medication  A few days ago I had a McDonalds meal and I definitely overate because I kept eating after feeling myself get full
rpdu90,t5_2qlaa,The area right under my ribcage felt tight but I ignored it and I didnt really notice it after that
rpdu90,t5_2qlaa,Yesterday I ate dinner and when I was trying to sleep that area felt like it was burning but when I woke up it felt okay
rpdu90,t5_2qlaa,Then today I ate and that area felt really uncomfortable and I started to feel nauseous
rpdu90,t5_2qlaa,I also had diarrhea and felt sick but I drank some baking soda water and that helped
rpdu90,t5_2qlaa,I still have that uncomfortable feeling in my stomach and whenever I push my stomach out I can feel it more in my upper abdomen than the lower part

s47fv5,t5_2rtve,Its worth it to avoid getting covid

st1fhj,t5_2saq9,hr Urinary Analysis Quick Question
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,Anyone who is diagnosed with POTSdysautonomia and had to have a hr urinary analysis
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,how did the results affect your treatment or outcome etc
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,I had all my autonomic tests in June 
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,but the hr urinary analysis referral that was requested by the neurologist has taken forever to come through
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,And at this point Im not sure what it is for exactly I seem to remember the neurologist saying something about seeing whether my kidneys were letting go of too much sodium
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,I know everyone is different
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,and I am not looking for medical advice
st1fhj,t5_2saq9,but any experience with how it was helpfulnot helpful for you personally  is much appreciated
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,Making jokes with a Walgreens employee I was at Walgreens getting my meds
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,I was looking for ibgrad to make sure I had enough
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,I asked a lady who worked there
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,asked where the ibgrad was
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,she did not know if they sold it
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,So we looked
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,she asked again what it was called
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,I told it is ibgrad
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,it is to help people with IBS
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,She looked at me and was I have it too
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,So we made jokes about it
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,I told mine is stress induced
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,hers was anxiety induced
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,So we made jokes
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,I told it is a shitty thing to have
sna2f4,t5_2s3g1,she laughed and said I am using that now

styika,t5_2s23e,Prednisone side effects when do they start
styika,t5_2s23e,Im in my first relapse since my diagnosis  years ago
styika,t5_2s23e,and my neuro prescribed me oral Prednisone mg pills
styika,t5_2s23e, per day for  days
styika,t5_2s23e,I havent taken steroids since I got mono  years ago
styika,t5_2s23e,so while waiting for the prescription to get worked out
styika,t5_2s23e,I scoured this sub for all things Prednisone
styika,t5_2s23e,I got some great advice on how to deal with the awful taste thank you
styika,t5_2s23e,but also got thoroughly freaked out by some of the side effects people mentioned
styika,t5_2s23e,I got past the first  pills yesterday
styika,t5_2s23e,expecting nasty side effects to hit me at any point
styika,t5_2s23e,The worst I got was some exacerbated insomnia last night
styika,t5_2s23e,which has been pretty normal during this relapse anyways
styika,t5_2s23e,so Im not sure I can attribute it to the meds
styika,t5_2s23e,So my question is
styika,t5_2s23e,for those of you who have taken Prednisone and experienced side effects
styika,t5_2s23e,how long after your first dose did you start to experience them
styika,t5_2s23e,I dont want to get my hopes up and think Im smooth sailing from here on out only to come crashing down today or tomorrow
styika,t5_2s23e,I cant seem to find it now
styika,t5_2s23e,but whoever suggested coating your tongue in dark chocolate before taking each prednisone pillgenius
styika,t5_2s23e,I only tasted two of those  pills
styika,t5_2s23e,and after tasting them
styika,t5_2s23e,I was SO thankful for that trick
styika,t5_2s23e,I looked ridiculous constantly licking a piece of dark chocolate
styika,t5_2s23e,and my husband started laughing so hard that I made him leave the kitchen so I could actually get the pills down
styika,t5_2s23e,  TLDR How long after taking your first dose of Prednisone did you experience side effects

ryejzh,t5_2rtve,Lupus and acne Hey everyone
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,I have a question about acne
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,Ive seen the rheum and she said Ive either got lupus or fibromyalgia
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,shes ordered a lot of tests but I dont know the results yet
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,She put me on hydroxycloroquine but Ive not taken it yet
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,I have been breaking out on my face really badly
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,worse than I ever had
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,I know lupus can affect the skin but Ive not heard of acne
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,just the rashes
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,Google was no help when I tried to look it up
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,I have not changed any skin products or diet so Im very confused about why Im breaking out
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,I have never had the malar rash even though I am very sensitive to the sun
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,I do get really bad sunburns so Im always very careful
ryejzh,t5_2rtve,Im just wondering if anyone else has experienced this
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,Has anyone experienced a rash after taking plaquenil
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,I have been on this for only two weeks and developed a rash that spread basically all over my body
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,I first noticed it on my inner thigh
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,then it went away
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,So I upped my dose per doctors recommendations and after about five days on mg a rash started spreading pretty rapidly
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,could feel it in my eyeballsears
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,It coincided with some pretty stressful stuff
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,so its hard to tell if its a flare or a reaction to the medication
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,I was able to see a dermatologist today
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,but the rash went down so we couldnt biopsy it
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,Really hoping Im not allergic to plaquenil
qhzdw9,t5_2rtve,I appreciate any help or shared experiences

r75sc3,t5_2r876,but then I got diagnosed with GPA Wegeners granulomatosis
r75sc3,t5_2r876,No tests confirmed it
r75sc3,t5_2r876,Chemo didnt help
r75sc3,t5_2r876,nor any other medication

qksh84,t5_2rtve,but theres a long-drawn out referral process through my PCP Ive already waited a couple of months
qksh84,t5_2rtve,I have no idea when Ill get an appointment
qksh84,t5_2rtve,I noticed  blistersore things on my lip and just though they were pimples
qksh84,t5_2rtve,Then my teeth started hurting when I bite down
qksh84,t5_2rtve,I have a sore bump on the roof of my mouth
qksh84,t5_2rtve,and now I see one on my gums
qksh84,t5_2rtve,Maybe thats why my teeth are hurting
qksh84,t5_2rtve,The inside of one nostril hurts never felt that before so I think I might have sores inside my nose
qksh84,t5_2rtve,The skin around and below my eyes is starting to feel hot and sore
qksh84,t5_2rtve,scaly areas of skin on my forearms are feeling irritated

q2uz5j,t5_2syer,How much is enough
q2uz5j,t5_2syer,How much do you all drink a day
q2uz5j,t5_2syer,If I drink  or more liters
q2uz5j,t5_2syer,I end up having to pee during the night
q2uz5j,t5_2syer,It seemzs  liter is recommended and more than that is not really necessary
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,not looking for medical advice This is probably gonna be a bit vent-y
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,For the last maybe - days I have had chest pain
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,that all get worse with activity
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,A few days ago I went to the ER for uncontrolled tachycardia and they did IV fluids and consulted the electrophysiology team
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,who increased my ivabradine
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,I was in the ER yesterday for an anaphylactic allergic reaction
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,but they essentially gave me prednisone and sent me home
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,The reaction recurred later that night and I managed it with multiple antihistamines
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,but today I havent had any allergic symptoms
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,I fainted while making a snack earlier totally out the blue
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,I was standing by the kitchen cabinet and was suddenly extremely dizzy and nauseous
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,then my vision blacked out entirely not my usual tunnel vision
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,just complete darkness for  seconds and then it came back
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,I sat down and noticed I was having a lot of chest heaviness and tightness and pain
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,and was struggling to take a deep breath
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,After - minutes of sitting and relaxing it calmed down a bit
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,but keeps coming back full-force when I stand or move
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,I dont feel like its anything dangerous because Im not really having palpitations or uncontrolled tachycardia
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,It just feels like my body is refusing to work
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,I was just covid tested yesterday and was negative
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,My primary care doctor just ignores me whenever Ive had similar issues in the past though it has never been quite this bad
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,Im supposed to see the nurse practitioner in his office next week
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,but I just wish I could find some kind of relief
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,Ive tried box breathing
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,pursed lip breathing
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,and none of it has worked
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,My area is also having an awful blizzard right now getting  ft of snow in hrs and so even if I wanted to go to an urgent care I probably couldnt
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,Really tired of the strange symptoms I get that dont seem to have any real cause
sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,Also wish the pulmonologist I was referred to had an appointment available before June

spw069,t5_2syer,No pain no problem
spw069,t5_2syer,Just wanna ask about a hypothetical situation
spw069,t5_2syer,So gf is studying in the medical field and she once told me that if pain was too much off a problem
spw069,t5_2syer,the doctors can always just cut off the nerve ending to that part of your body
spw069,t5_2syer,So if its always in my big toe
spw069,t5_2syer,Cant I just cut off the pain receptors to that part and never worry about goat again
spw069,t5_2syer,Assuming it doesnt travel to another place lol
spw069,t5_2syer,But ofc it will cause permeant joint damage but ehhhh you wont feel it so
spw069,t5_2syer,no problem right

sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,After Bad Shroom Trip
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,having recurring problems
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Am I slipping into psychosis
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Ill try to keep it as brief as I can but heres the absolute tldr Had a bad shroom trip
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,thought Im losing my mind
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Things calmed down but similar feelings andor fear of getting back into that state of mind have come up multiple times and made me panic
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,I had a bad shroom trip last summer Ive had good trips in the past
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,I thought I was losing my mind
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,it seemed like my thoughts were not my own anymore and I wasnt able to make sure Im not controlled by some other entity
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,This situation made me panic profusely
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,So much so that I called friends for help which Ive never done in my life before this moment and asked them to come around and make sure that Im not going crazy
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,If no one would have been able to come
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,I would have definitely gone to a hospital
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,I was really unwell
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,After everything calmed down
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,things went back to normal and I filed it under bad trip and my conclusion was psychedelics are too dangerous for me despite some good experiences in the past
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Ive not touched them again
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Since this experience however Ive had multiple moments where I felt the fear of slipping into the same state of mind come up
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,While in this state of fear Im then trying to think my way out of it
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,But this seems to just push me even further into it
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,This has caused me to experience panic-like-attacks where I started hiding under a blanket till that feeling of panic passed
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,This has happened  times
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,and a few times it was close to it
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,I am actually terrified of it happening again
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Questions Is what Im experiencing here something we can consider to be a psychosis
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Or am I just experiencing some sort of anxiety
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Should I see a psychiatrist or a therapist here
sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,Any other tips or reading material you can recommend

sa8xqd,t5_2r876,Here is what I am feeling guilty about
sa8xqd,t5_2r876,I dont do any treatments besides take albuterol inhaler when I develop a cough
sa8xqd,t5_2r876,This method seems to have work for me
sa8xqd,t5_2r876,but do you guys think its sustainable
sa8xqd,t5_2r876,I go running  times a week for  mile sessions and I feel like it keeps my function afloat
sa8xqd,t5_2r876,I dont do a race pace but enough to definitely get my lungs working
sa8xqd,t5_2r876,am I doing myself a disservice by not doing the treatment regimen everyone is doing
sa8xqd,t5_2r876,On top of running I do BJJ x a week on my cardio days

sinlau,t5_2saq9,Exercise with POTS  CFS My cardiologist has given me the CHOPLevine protocol for POTS
sinlau,t5_2saq9,I have tried it many times before and not noticed an improvement in my symptoms
sinlau,t5_2saq9,other than my muscles feeling stronger
sinlau,t5_2saq9,Id normally end up in bed for hours after as well because Id push myself way too much
sinlau,t5_2saq9,Im desperate to get back to exercise
sinlau,t5_2saq9,Ive been housebound for  years now
sinlau,t5_2saq9,my worst symptom being brain fog
sinlau,t5_2saq9,I feel like I have energy but then end up doing too much and making myself worse
sinlau,t5_2saq9,Does anyone else have POTS  CFS and has found a balance with exercise
sinlau,t5_2saq9,I think Im going to give it a try again but reduce the times and go very lightly
sinlau,t5_2saq9,I understand GET isnt recommended now and thats whats concerning me as being a protocol its very similar
sinlau,t5_2saq9,Its so difficult when exercise is recommended for POTS but the opposite for CFS
sinlau,t5_2saq9,I just really want to get some of my life back
sinlau,t5_2saq9,I was originally diagnosed with CFS
sinlau,t5_2saq9,then a few years later POTS
sinlau,t5_2saq9,The past few years POTS has seemed to be my main diagnosis
sinlau,t5_2saq9,Ive also been referred to an exercise intolerance clinic for POTS since my CPET showed my muscles werent working properly  I have metabolic dysfunction
sinlau,t5_2saq9,Would appreciate any advice

siahcn,t5_2s23e,It comes and goes
siahcn,t5_2s23e,but sometimes last a while

sti2iy,t5_2s23e,Touched base with neuro
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,This is a happy post
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,I feel like all of my posts in the past months have been rants but Id just like to share how happy I am with how my appointment went
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,I finally saw neuro in office after  months
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,because I didnt make an appt sooner
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,I was able to get my kesimpta worked out as I havent had it since the end of dec
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,which was a super big source of anxiety for me
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,I was ensured that it was fine and it wasnt as big a deal as my brain tricked me into thinking
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,I receive it tmw
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,we also talked fatigue
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,My labs came back and it turns out Im anemic and my vitamin d levels were seriously lowwith supplements Im almost positive my debilitating fatigue goes away
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,And in the case it doesnt we discussed provigil
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,My dexterity and cognitive tests came back a bit worse than in June but my nurse practitioner let me know we can work on that as well
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,My past due MRI was scheduled and I even was able to make an appt with a health psychologist who specializes in ms patients
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,I left feeling so supported and back in charge of my ms and overall care
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,I have a follow up in  months already scheduled so I dont even have to worry or forget to make my follow up appt
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,Just feeling like I actually have a handle on my health again
sti2iy,t5_2s23e,Thanks for listening
soafcr,t5_2r876,Birth Control and CF Like two years ago Id take this really good hormonal birth control pill that would completely rid of my period but then I got lung embolism and had to stop
soafcr,t5_2r876,Since then I have an IUD and I take FIVE birth control pills non-hormonal everyday and I STILL get my period
soafcr,t5_2r876,I am not even on Orkambi nor Trikafta at the moment so there is no medication there to interact with the birth control
soafcr,t5_2r876,Anyone else have similar problems
qezp5g,t5_2r876,Anyone have experience with this combo
qezp5g,t5_2r876,long story short Im currently going through some GI complications and Ive been on Amitiza for the past couple months
qezp5g,t5_2r876,Its reeaaallly helped
qezp5g,t5_2r876,I also struggle with getting back on for GI reasons was successfully on it awhile back
qezp5g,t5_2r876,also a long story
qezp5g,t5_2r876,Reading up on Amitiza
qezp5g,t5_2r876,its a chloride channel activator
qezp5g,t5_2r876,So Im curious if it might be helpful to make my attempts to get back on Trikafta easier
qezp5g,t5_2r876,I know this is a CF center question and Ill be asking them as well
qezp5g,t5_2r876,but its Sunday and it popped in my head

suyyt3,t5_2saq9,First dizziness attack  years ago after gym
suyyt3,t5_2saq9,After that each time I go back to gym have to drop within a month due to dizziness after working out
suyyt3,t5_2saq9,Havent been diagnosed for POTS but seem to have most of the symptoms
suyyt3,t5_2saq9,Anyone with similar HR  story
suyyt3,t5_2saq9,Cardiologist says heart structure is fine and lying down EKG normal results
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,Esophogastric mucosa So I saw the surgeon today
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,and it was so helpful
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,He said overall
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,Im more a risk of over treatment than under treatment
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,I have a patch of ectopic gastric mucosa 
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa, just below my upper esophageal sphincter
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,which produces acid
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,He said its possible to have acid from there
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,and no acid reflux
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,Apparently only  of patients he operates on have a patch like that
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,but  of those have Barretts
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,He says he has occasionally gone in just to ablate the patch and prevent issues
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,He set me up for a hr Bravo
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,and Im wondering if I should consider the ablation of the tissue
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,He is a reflux specialist
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,and unless my Bravo tells him differently than he thinks
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,isnt thinking surgery at this time
rh4sm1,t5_2qlaa,Edit tried to fix the name of the patch
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,Anyone else have a very irregular heartbeat all the time
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,I dont just mean fast my heart rate doesnt have a regular rhythm anymore at rest and weirdly its more regular with I stand or when I get severely tachycardic
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,There isnt any consistency for more than a few beats at most
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,Its been like this for a few months
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,Its very erratic
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,some times more than others
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,Itll randomly speed up and down within a couple or several seconds
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,It can be  something for a few seconds
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,then something close to 
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,then maybe way slower again etc
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,Heart rate trackers also dont work properly anymore
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,its always off from manually counting
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,I thought something was wrong with my smartwatch until I tried with my pulse ox and got the same thing
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,they always used to be spot on with manual measurements
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,I have a feeling this is due to not having a consistent rate
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,I have a follow up appointment in April but my cardiologist always blames every symptom on pots
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,no matter if it seems completely unrelated such as SVT-like episodes with randomsudden rate of  bpm at rest that he wont address and tries to lump it in as a pots symptoms
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,Last cardiologist was the same way
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,At least this time hell actually be able to notice when he listens to my heart rate that the rate isnt regular
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,but I have a feeling hell blow it off
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,I was just wondering though if anyone else experiences this
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,I have a gut feeling this isnt really right
sxy06a,t5_2saq9,something has to be causing this
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,Fair ups during high stress 
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,diagnosed with psychosis induced by PTSD in 
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,I am not looking for medical advice
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,more so if people experience symptoms of psychosis for a few days at a time that go away on its own
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,I know this should not be the case without meds
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,which is why this stumps me and think i could be miss diagnosed
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,Having thoughts it may be related to OCD rather than a psychosis
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,The theme is always religious persecution in nature
sn3jdr,t5_2tyg2,Thanks  The only meds I am in now are antidepressants and a low dose of olanzapine as PRN

rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Getting Toupet Fundoplication tomorrow
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and nice messages appreciated
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Im  F and suffering from a weak esophagus and  cm hiatal hernia
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I am receiving the toupet fundoplication tomorrow morning
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Im ready to be able to eat pizza with my friends and not writhe trying to sleep later
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,or be able to look under my bed for something without bile leaking into my mouth
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Ive been through lots of testing and its been determined I REALLY need this surgery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,My grandmother actually had the same surgery done by the same surgeon  years ago and shes doing amazing
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,so Im hoping for good outcomes
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I have to say
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I am very nervous about recovery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I know its not good to do this but of course I looked for other peoples opinions and experiences and Ive seen people saying they got worse after surgery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,or that the pain was unbearable and they werent normal for months and months afterward
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Im a naturally overthinking and anxious person
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,so any advice or words of encouragement would be so appreciated
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Ill update tomorrow afterwards when I can and tell you all my experience   UPDATE    Hi guys
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Ive been post-op I think around - hours Im not sure
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but we started about 
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa, hrs late cuz of a delay with his other patient
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I was told the surgery went well and everything was successful
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,When I woke up I was very out of it but I will warn you all
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,its probably different for everyone
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but the pain from the gas they pump in was excruciating
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Definitely a  on the pain scale
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Its already gone down to maybe a 
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but it was the worst pain Ive ever felt for a little while there
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,None of the pain came from the actual surgery so thats good and bad in my opinion haha
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Its about  am where Im at and Ive been sleeping on and off
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Ive had the tiniest bit of water and lukewarm chicken broth which was actually amazing lmao
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Theyve had to give me lots of good pain meds and some nausea meds occasionally but other than that Ive been fine
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Ive been up to the bathroom  times and it gets easier every time
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,it is a little strange to pee cuz you can feel your stomach spam a little
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It doesnt hurt at all and you can barely feel it
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,its just weird
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,   I cant really bend down yet at all and I still have some dull achy pain in my shoulders but hopefully that will subside soon
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Ill let you guys know any other updates I have
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,MINI UPDATE  Hey guys
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Woke up around  and the shoulder pain was back
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa, got more morphine
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Morphine is nice
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Still hurts like a bitch tho   UPDATE  Hey everyone
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I am so sorry I never continued updating this thread
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I switched reddit accounts so I never even saw how many people were asking about my experience
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Heres what I can tell you after about  months
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,The recovery was HARD
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Very very difficult
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but worth it
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It was about  months before I got back to eating completely normally
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but since then Ive only had  or  episodes of something getting stuck
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and it usually passes within minutes
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and even those  or  happened months ago
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Something not a lot of people talk about with the recovery is lack of energy
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It was probably a month or more before I had enough energy to not nap at all during the day
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and it was about until I could eat completely normally that I had a normal amount of energy
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,The pain with the recovery was pretty intense for the first week or so
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,then eventually subsided
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,The shoulder pain from the gas right after the surgery was some of the worst pain Ive ever experienced in my life
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but it gets a lot better once you walk it off
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,that was difficult too
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It was pretty difficult to do literally anything other than lay down or sit up on pillows and sleep
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I had to have help sitting up for about a week
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,All of this stuff from the first week
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,subsided pretty quickly as I started to be able to get back to normal life
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Since I woke up from the surgery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I havent had a single GERDacid reflux issue
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,The surgery DOES work for most and for me
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and it DOES work IMMEDIATELY
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It was life changing
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I didnt even know most peoples stomach didnt burn painfully when they were hungry I thought that was normal until after this surgery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,As for weight loss
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I weighed about  when I got the surgery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and now I weigh about 
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Most of the weight loss can be attributed to this surgery and the liquid diet and eating much smaller portions because your stomach is a third smaller
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,however in my personal experience I also started taking a stimulant Vyvanse for my ADHD which makes me eat a LOT less and also have impulse control over my snacking
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I still believe you will lose a good bit of weight just from the surgery alone no matter who you are because of the liquid diet and eating smaller portions ESPECIALLY the smaller portions
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I can hardly eat anything at one time anymore
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but I am hungry more times in a day because of this
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,What I want everyone to know about this surgery that not a lot of people talk about is that
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,in my experience
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,it is more of a trade-off than a fix
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I havent had a single issue with GERD since I woke up afterward
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but I also have not been able to expel gas from my system or have a normal bowel movement since then either
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I have been taking the absolute maximum strength Gas X and Metamucil every morning and every night since my last surgery follow up appointment because these issues never got better
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,If I miss one dose of either of these supplements
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,it will take  days or more to get regular again
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,And the supplements dont completely fix it
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I also eat very very small amounts
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,which was nice at first cuz I needed to lose weight
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but now that Im at a healthy weight its kinda aggravating eating such small amounts many times a day to satiate hunger
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but thats probably the least significant issue Ive had
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Another thing Ive encountered that I havent heard much about is sugar intolerance
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I have a much harder time consuming sugar now
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,especially in drinks
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I cant drink any drink with any more than maybe  of your daily value of sugar because it hurts my stomach so bad
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I just turned  in February and I have come to terms with the fact that my drink choices are very limited due to the fact that carbonation and sugar make me sick
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,will make my stomach hurt so bad I have to go home and go to bed if I even have just a few sips
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but its worth it to have to make some lifestyle changes to get rid of the acid reflux
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I will say though
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,the carbonation issues have gotten less and less as time has gone on
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I can even drink seltzers now as long as they dont have lots of sugar
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I am also unable
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I havent had anything come up at all since then
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Its tried a few times though
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and let me tell you
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,In my personal experience
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,the few times my body has tried to make me throw up
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Ive been stuck retching for up to an hour or more
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Its very painful
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and it will keep going for a long time
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I contracted a stomach virus a few months ago and had to go to the hospital because I kept uncontrollably retching to the point I couldnt breathe and almost passed out
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It was very scary
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but that was only  time
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and after that I asked for a stronger anti-nausea pill I take Zofran now and I have it on me AT ALL TIMES
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,just like my inhaler
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Id suggest if you feel at all like you might be sick
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Other than those few times though
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,the inability to throw up hasnt been much of a issue
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,also as a side note
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I still cant lift things that are very heavyawkward without it hurting the site
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Also the scars healed up pretty well
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Still visible of course
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but Im covered in scars from being a wild child and working in a kitchen lol so I dont really care about them
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but for anyone that does
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I dont think they go away for a while
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Im very very glad
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,evenespecially at my young age
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,that I chose to have this surgery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I was in so much pain and couldnt do a lot of things normal people my age could because it hurt me so badmade me sick
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I couldnt sleep without my whole bed being propped up
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I couldnt eat  hours before bed
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I couldnt eat anything spicy or tomato without completely regretting it later
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It absolutely changed my life
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,The recovery was hell
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I had to make some lifestyle changes
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I still cant do some things normal people my age can do
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but its worlds better than what I was dealing with
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I could immediately sleep at any elevation without it burning and choking on bile
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I can eat pretty much any food I want except for much sugar
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,but thats okay
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I can eat right before bed if I want
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I can eat spicy food all day long
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I can eat Mexican
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I have so much more freedom
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,It still does cost 
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,money of course
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,still a little freedom
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,You have to be careful to take care of it well
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,You want it to last as long as possible
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and you dont want to hurt yourself
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Im so sorry this update didnt come out sooner
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,I hope this can help many many people in making a decision
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Peace and love to all my GERD homies   TLDR Im very happy with my decision to go through with the surgery and most people would benefit from it I believe
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,there are many trade-offsnuances I wish I had been more aware of
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,My quality of life is worlds better after this surgery and I would encourage everyone who qualifies to discuss it with your doctors and specialists
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,and dont be afraid of the recovery
rh5ety,t5_2qlaa,Its so worth it
ro707k,t5_2rtve,Itchy skin and hyperpigmentation I have extremely itchy skin almost every night
ro707k,t5_2rtve,I really try not to scratch because it makes it worse but it affects my sleeping and basically everything in my life

s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,Adderall or medication Fatigue anyone
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,I have POTS and ADHD Im being medicated for both at the same time
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,I love being able to function with Adderall
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,but I do not like that as soon as my Adderall activates
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,severe fatigue sets in immediately
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,I feel like needing a coma level nap pretty much as soon as I feel it working
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,I cant tell if this is just Adderall by itself doing this
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,or if its because Adderall worsens my POTS
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,It noticeably worsens my POTS symptoms
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,Including the vision loss
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,my POTS still feels worse long after the Adderall has worn off as well
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,On days where my bpm is naturally worse than normal on its own without the meds
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,I feel like I still dont get the kind of fatigue that Adderall gives me
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,This is the main reason why Im unsure if the fatigue is coming from the worsening of POTS or if its Adderall doing this on its own
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,I know fatigue after Adderall has worn off is normal for most people which I also experience that post Adderall crash
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,I just dont think fatigue as soon as you take it is the norm for most ADHD peeps
s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,or suggestions are appreciated

shjhkx,t5_2saq9,headaches are my typical symptoms during bad episodes
shjhkx,t5_2saq9,I was severely stressed around the time the GI symptoms showed up abusive relationship so I thought that might have triggered something
shjhkx,t5_2saq9,I thought Id check in here and see if anyone had experienced something similar in case my gastritis isnt treated by antibiotics

qfn1ir,t5_2syer,I had a gout flare up for the first time  years ago
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,The pain was so incredible and my ankle was so swollen I was positive I had broken my ankle somehow
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,Went to the doctor
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,he took my blood and told me it was gout
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,He gave me a cortisone shot and I immediately felt better
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,Never had another gout attack so I figured it was a random one time deal
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,It hit me again for only the nd time ever and first time in  years so I had forgotten how freaking painful it is
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,For a few days it was manageable as I took extra strenght tylenol
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,used some lidocaine cream and just walked with a limp thinking it would go away after a few days
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,Well now it has gotten worse
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,I cant put any pressure on it at all so pretty much cant walk
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,The pain is unrelenting
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,just there all the time and the tylenol and cream isnt cutting it anymore
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,Like I said its only the nd time ever for me and I have not made any changes to my diet recently so I am not sure what triggered it
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,I tried to make an appointment with my doctor but they are booked solid for  days
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,I begged snd pleaded for them to squeeze me in because I am desperate at this point but no dice
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,I called an urgent care and the girl pretty much told me that I was more than welcome to come in but they are so slammed she cant guarantee I would be seen
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,So my question is
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,is there anything I can eat or do to help with this attack
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,Any home remedies any of you fine people would suggest
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,I have had multiple broken bones
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,multiple surgeries etc
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,but nothing compares to the pain from a gout attack
qfn1ir,t5_2syer,My ankle is the size of a softball
pw30ed,t5_2r876,My daughter was just diagnosed with CF and I am finding it all very overwhelming tbh
pw30ed,t5_2r876,She was born less than  days ago and looks the picture of health
pw30ed,t5_2r876,Her diagnosis was picked up on a heel prick test mid last week and since then we have a team of specialist physios
pw30ed,t5_2r876,social workers and a few more that I cant even remember anymore here to help
pw30ed,t5_2r876,I find this all very overwhelming and have been very positive because I am being told the outlook is very different now to even what it was  years ago etc but I knew nothing about this  weeks ago l
pw30ed,t5_2r876,and now I have a full day team at the ready to help my daughter until she reaches yrs old
pw30ed,t5_2r876,I am being positive but I am extremely anxious with no clear vision on how her daily routine will look in  months
pw30ed,t5_2r876, years etc
pw30ed,t5_2r876,We are obviously at early stages but I feel grief off loss but have lost nothing
pw30ed,t5_2r876,I have a feeling of worry of a future that I am told is bright
pw30ed,t5_2r876,I feel like I am not being told the bad news yet or is it just that they cant tell how this is going to go
pw30ed,t5_2r876,I feel highly confused by the many versions and struggles that people have
pw30ed,t5_2r876,i feel astonished at the support within the CF community
pw30ed,t5_2r876,Anyway thats my sudden diagnosis
pw30ed,t5_2r876,I hope others can relate
r0lrvs,t5_2r876,Vestibular test Ive got a VNG test tomorrow
r0lrvs,t5_2r876,Its to check my balance as Ive had dizzy spells  its affected my balance
r0lrvs,t5_2r876,Its been much better of late  Im worried the vestibular test could set it off again
r0lrvs,t5_2r876,It basically consists of putting on these camera glasses that read my eyemovement whe they put warm water into my ears
r0lrvs,t5_2r876,Im so nervous  want to cancel it because inducing a dizzy spell  maybe restarting my dizziness again doesnt appeal to me
r0lrvs,t5_2r876,Has anyone had this done

q3vm4v,t5_2syer,How often do you have flares in multiple joints
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,I had my first gout attack about  years ago in the typical big toe
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,I had averaged one or two max per year for about  years
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,About two years ago
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,I had an episode for a few weeks that would come back after stopping steroids
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,I have some kidney issues and see a nephrologist regularly
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,I was put on allopurinol and a daily low dose of prednisone and this helped immensely
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,Only had maybe two attacks last couple of years
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,Im no longer on daily prednisone because of kidney disease improvement
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,but I still take mg of allopurinol
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,I had a flare up on Sunday after several bad diet and lifestyle choices for a few days
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,It started in the bone on my right side of my right foot
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,Started to improve but then my big toe on my right foot went ape shit Tuesday night and I was awake all night with throbbing pain
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,My nephrologist recommended the mg dose of prednisone for  days which I started yesterday
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,Seemed a lot better last night
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,but I woke up today and it feels like my fucking right ankle is getting an attack
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,I have a complicated situation with my kidney disease so I sort of let my nephrologist who is really good guide decisions on most anything
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,Im starting to think it might not be a bad idea to enlist the help of a rheumatologist
q3vm4v,t5_2syer,Anyone else have issues with multi joint gout attacks
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,IBS treatment during eating disorder recovery TRIGGER WARNING mention of restrictive ED  Ive been struggling with IBS for years but havent tried seeking treatment until recently
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,My main reason for avoiding treatment was bc of my eating disorder ED
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,which wasis highly restrictive
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,Most treatments for IBS involve well balanced diets and obviously that was not something I was particularity interested in
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,But recently ive been working really hard on my recovery and now am now in a much better place mentally to start considering IBS treatment
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,I have talked to my doctors
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,and as Im sure many of you have also experienced
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,theyre completely useless
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,Its clear that any treatment plan is going to be one that I come up with myself based off of my own research
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,So I started doing a ton of research and it seems like one of the biggest suggestions is trying a low FODMAP diet
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,I understand why this might work
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,and why it might even really help me
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,but at this point in my ED recovery I simply cannot handle cutting out or restricting certain foods
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,Im comfortable introducing new foods Ive read a lot about how increasing soluble fiber can help
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,just not taking away
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,Maybe one day but not today
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,My question is if anyone has other remedies that I might be able to try
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,Ive heard things like peppermint oil
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,can help but sadly theres just not that much info out there
suuqdq,t5_2s3g1,Any suggestions would be immensely appreciated

squpex,t5_2s3g1,Spent the first half of that period trying to fight it and getting nowhere
squpex,t5_2s3g1,and the second half learning to live with it
squpex,t5_2s3g1,where I would have bad days but overall it was manageable and I could still work and go out and do normal things
squpex,t5_2s3g1,The past year and a half it has got worse and I do not know what to do
squpex,t5_2s3g1,By the time I was  Id worked out a routine where I would wake up
squpex,t5_2s3g1,eat some breakfast
squpex,t5_2s3g1,have a coffee  cigarette and then go about  times and I would feel emptyrelieved enough to go about my day
squpex,t5_2s3g1,I came off cigarettes so continued the process with vaping
squpex,t5_2s3g1,which still worked
squpex,t5_2s3g1,This slowly turned into needing to go  times before relieved enough
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Now I am vaping
squpex,t5_2s3g1,going to the toilet
squpex,t5_2s3g1,going to the toilet

squpex,t5_2s3g1,I am trying to use this time to try and de-stress as much as possible and try some different remedies etc
squpex,t5_2s3g1,although it feels like finding a needle in a haystack finding something that will suddenly work for me
squpex,t5_2s3g1,especially given some things may take a few weeks or months to begin working
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Symptoms   Wake up with body feeling like its being ripped in half  Pain crampydull hurts more when breathing in
squpex,t5_2s3g1,This pain is constant at some level
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Lower abdomen so sensitive you could rest a sheet of paper on it and it would feel uncomfortable
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Struggle to find any clothes with a waistband in the Goldilocks zone of tight enough to stay up but loose enough to be barely applying any pressure pretty sure I have visceral hypersensitivity
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Pain can also go around lower back
squpex,t5_2s3g1,and rectum can feel full towards end of day
squpex,t5_2s3g1,after eating  Trapped wind  Gas  Bloating  Incomplete evacuation always and soreness afterwards  Constipation during day  Overactive bladder always been weak
squpex,t5_2s3g1,but has got so bad over last  years it is now utterly miserable
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Not sure if related to IBS
squpex,t5_2s3g1,but frequency and urge are off the scale  Chronic tension headaches back of head
squpex,t5_2s3g1,since  years old  Treatments  Remedies tried for IBS

squpex,t5_2s3g1,I have been in and out of the GP and numerous hospitals for  years now
squpex,t5_2s3g1,I have had various scans
squpex,t5_2s3g1,tried gluten free
squpex,t5_2s3g1,dairy free  FODMAP diets
squpex,t5_2s3g1,food diaries kept and no patterns found
squpex,t5_2s3g1,My diet is varied and quite healthy
squpex,t5_2s3g1,I do not drink much alcohol and exercise regularly
squpex,t5_2s3g1,This condition has really limited who I have been able to be as a person in adulthood
squpex,t5_2s3g1,which makes me really sad
squpex,t5_2s3g1,I always hoped I would find something that worked
squpex,t5_2s3g1,but at least I found a way to make it manageable and could still work
squpex,t5_2s3g1,go on holiday and stick to most events
squpex,t5_2s3g1,lately it has become completely debilitating and I am struggling to live any sort of life at all
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Guess Im just looking for any help at all
squpex,t5_2s3g1,Any suggestions or ideas based on what Ive written above
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Going to a cardiologist for the first time in  years Recently my chest pains have been very painful
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Up until a few months ago
syngv8,t5_2saq9,my chest pains were mild and could be ignored fairly easily
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Now I get sharp intense pain
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Urgent care couldnt find anything even with CT scans
syngv8,t5_2saq9,so they referred me to cardiology next week
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Do you think this is a new chapter of my POTS journey or will cardiology actually be useful for once
syngv8,t5_2saq9,I have no idea how to describe these pains
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Theres always some level of pain or discomfort with sharp shooting pains mixed in
syngv8,t5_2saq9,The last doctor I spoke to was irritated I couldnt explain what the constant pain felt like
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Any info to help calm my nerves till next week would be appreciated
syngv8,t5_2saq9,Stress and POTS dont go well and Ill be stressing over this for a whole week

rhitmq,t5_2r876,rough pneumonia recovery just spent two weeks in the hospital with pretty severe pneumonia
rhitmq,t5_2r876,i was told my infection was cleared and was feeling pretty decent as of my release  days ago
rhitmq,t5_2r876,about a day ago started to feel pretty weak not as bad as i was when i went in but my energy levels has declined and im breathing pretty heavy again  with with some aches and pains in my torso
rhitmq,t5_2r876,i  am waiting callbacks from my doctors to suss this out
rhitmq,t5_2r876,its very different from other times ive been released which i always felt good as new
rhitmq,t5_2r876,has anyone just had a brutal recovery from pneumonia
rhitmq,t5_2r876,i cant help but feel it wasnt totally cleared up and is hitting me back again
ove9ly,t5_2r876,Feeling sick from laxatives
ove9ly,t5_2r876,So recently my bowels keep getting a bit blocked and going to the loo just isnt nearly as easy as it should be
ove9ly,t5_2r876,I go and its a struggle and still feel like I need to go again after but cant
ove9ly,t5_2r876,So my CF team had me come in at am yesterday so they could take some blood and give me some gastrografin
ove9ly,t5_2r876,Theyre supposed to be taken ml  x a day followed by a glass of water
ove9ly,t5_2r876,I had one dose yesterday but I was seeing my boyfriend in the evening so didnt take the evening dose as I didnt want to be dying on the loo for ages at his house
ove9ly,t5_2r876,The first dose didnt do much
ove9ly,t5_2r876,I stayed over and came home this afternoon and took my next dose
ove9ly,t5_2r876,This time it was effective and kicked in about  minutes ago
ove9ly,t5_2r876,But now I feel a bit lightheaded
ove9ly,t5_2r876,a tiny bit feverish and a little bit sick
ove9ly,t5_2r876,This was only second dose of it but Im thinking about laying off of it and skipping tonights dose and then giving it another go tomorrow as Im still a little bloated
ove9ly,t5_2r876,Its not meant to be a very strong laxative but Im not feeling very good after my second dose
ove9ly,t5_2r876,Sometimes CF is just not a very dignified illness
ove9ly,t5_2r876,Anyone else had a similar experience on laxatives
ove9ly,t5_2r876,Edit I am also diabetic and my blood sugars started heading south after the gastrografin kicked in
ove9ly,t5_2r876,Which isnt reassuring me

rwa1hf,t5_2syer,Would appreciate your opinions I have had relatively high UA for yrs  yr now
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,in the 
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,Rarely have a flare up say once per year and I can normally make the stiffness disappear with mg of prednisone one pill
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,I do have some stiffness in foot joints periodically over the course of the year
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,but they are not disabling
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,I have been on plant based diet no meat or dairy for  years
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,Exercise pretty regularly but could lose about  pounds
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,I average about - litres of water per day
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,My beer drinking  is limited to about once a month where I could have  beer prefer light beer in a sitting
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,This diet and beer drinking does not seem to affect my UA at all
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,Never have had an outbreak even with excessive
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,multi day beer drinking ie
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,once per year guys trip
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,I have confirmed gout and some very minor signs of damage in my foot joints
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,Had meeting with Rheumatologist today and she is recommending Allo because she wants my UA lower and in her opinion it is my last option
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,I am resistant to life long medication but absolutely will do if best option
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,The only diet changes or lifestyle changes I could try would be cutting out high fructose sugar I consume too much
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,lose the  pounds and exercise even more ie
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,For those with experience
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,do you think any or all of this would make any meaningful difference for my UA level
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,My Rheumatologist is suggesting to start on a low dosage of Allo as she has seen with people similar to meAllo can sometimes be effective at even mg per day
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,Of course she will monitor monthly maybe even bi-weeklyin the short term and will raise until effective but I am curious if any of you had success with a low doses of Allo
rwa1hf,t5_2syer,Any other pieces of advicewisdom are appreciated
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,Im afraid to take medication Lamotrigine Hi
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,I had a possible seizure in May I dislocated my shoulder while sleeping but I was alone so nobody could see
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,I had another seizure after falling asleep in October after very stressful days
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,My girlfriend saw it
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,and I went to the neurologist and had MRI and EEG scans done
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,the MRI scan was fine and they didnt find any conclusive with my awake EEG scan
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,The neurologist told me that some people have only one seizure in their lives and that I probably didnt have to worry
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,Life was good until last Thursday when I had another seizure at  AM while sleeping
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,I went back to the neurologist
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,he told me that the decision to take medicine was 
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,since my EEG was inconclusive and the MRI scan was fine
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,I asked him what should I do and he said hed take the medicine for - years  some yoga  exercise  meditation and that if after  years I was fine
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,we could stop gradually the medicine
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,The problem Im very scared of the potential side effects
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,Im very scared of messing with my body if its not necessary
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,I dont understand why he didnt recommend we did an EEG while asleep or something similar just to make sure its epilepsy
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,Ive been trying to figure out if theres anything I could do that could help me instead of the medicine
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,I know stress has been the trigger for my seizures
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,so I could try not to get stressed or whatever
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,I just dont know what to do
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,Nobody in my family has had epilepsy before
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,My GF doesnt understand me
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,and she says I should take it without worries
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,She doesnt understand why I would worry about the side effects
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,Sorry for the rant
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,Im probably in denial
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,but I dont know what I should do
rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,What would you do in my case
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,Been suffering from IBS-C for over  years now
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,IBGard used to be my savior but now is my worst enemy
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,Any ideas as to why
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,I used to take an IBGard whenever I had any bowel discomfort and it was a life saverso much so that I was able to live my life completely notmally
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,randomly in the middle of 
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,I took one and it gave me painful diarrhea and gas
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,Since then I havent been able to take it or any other peppermint capsule without having incredible stomach pains and waterypainful BMs
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,Nothing else impacts me that way
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,Any idea as to why the switch occurred
smx7hg,t5_2s3g1,It doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me
p59g3c,t5_2syer,Urate fact or hypothesis
p59g3c,t5_2syer,I understand the thinking behind the idea of urate crystals slowly going back into solution when serum UA drops below 
p59g3c,t5_2syer, and stays there
p59g3c,t5_2syer,This makes sense
p59g3c,t5_2syer,but how do we really know that this is what actually happens
p59g3c,t5_2syer,Is this just a hypothesis or are there experimental data that demonstrate it
p59g3c,t5_2syer,Or do we know of anyone who has been able to go back to a normal diet
p59g3c,t5_2syer,without recurrence of gout and without drugs
p59g3c,t5_2syer,after a sufficient waiting time to allow for this hypothetical disappearance of the urates
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,Ive been diagnosed with epilepsy since I was   now but have been having seizures basically my entire life
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,I have absence seizures
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,When I had my first EEG
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,it was only an hour long but felt like  minutes
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,They said I had had  seizures within that time frame
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,My seizures only last a couple of seconds but I have them a lot throughout the day
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,I find I still have a few
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,Its why I cant drive
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,Ive never been able to drive
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,my dad has epilepsy but even he doesnt understand because he has grand mal and is seizure free
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,Its hard having petit mal or absence seizures because its hard to explain and doesnt feel as valid as other seizures
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,I struggle with the fact I cant drive a lot
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,This affects where I can live
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,what job I can do
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,Right now I have a remote job I absolutely hate so that I dont have to worry about finding transportation back and forth from another job
rs7xvp,t5_2s1h9,Its making miserable and triggering my depression

suzkof,t5_2saq9,Patterns and triggers in bounding heart beat
suzkof,t5_2saq9,I read through previous posts about bounding or hard heart beats that you can feel through your body
suzkof,t5_2saq9,I see a lot of people found certain types of food to be a trigger
suzkof,t5_2saq9,such as oily greasy foods
suzkof,t5_2saq9,I started keeping track of my bounding heart beat and noticed it always happens around 
suzkof,t5_2saq9,no matter what I eat it always happens at 
suzkof,t5_2saq9,I also usually eat between -
suzkof,t5_2saq9,so maybe its a result of digestion
suzkof,t5_2saq9,I also find that around  is when I get most fatigued during the day
suzkof,t5_2saq9,Anyone else have a pattern like this

r36kou,t5_2rtve,and sleeping together

qh32zk,t5_2syer,halfway way between the main joint and the next joint
qh32zk,t5_2syer,Where you would wear a ring
qh32zk,t5_2syer,Is been like  months
qh32zk,t5_2syer,the skin is healed over it
qh32zk,t5_2syer,I havent had any pain in my right foot
qh32zk,t5_2syer,My first and main attacks have been mainly in my left toe
qh32zk,t5_2syer,But they bounced around
qh32zk,t5_2syer,after it would clear sometimes it would move to the pinky side of my foot
qh32zk,t5_2syer,Maybe something with my white blood cells
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,Im in no way looking for a medical opinion just some advice  Okay so Im at  year old female
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,and Ive suspected lupus for a very long time maybe like  years
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,I had a range of symptoms
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,So Ive gotten basic blood work done
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,multiple ER visits for pain and what not
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,I informed my primary care physician when I was pregnant that I was worried about lupus since I have a couple family members that have lupus and she COMPLETELY disregarded and laughed it off
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,I was so devastated
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,Im going through what I personally think Is a flair
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,the only thing different is I dont have the face rash this time
rqc8ay,t5_2rtve,but what were your first symptoms of lupus and how did you get your doctor to test you for lupus and not totally disregarded you
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,Pressure headaches Im a human-Barometric-thermometer now
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,With everything MS has taken from me
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,its given me something back Human thermometer superpowers
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,For the last two years
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,Ive developed dull headaches whenever it was about to rain
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,It may be a day before
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,or hours before a storm hits
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,Ive gotten to the point where I can predict the rain better than the weatherman
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,Its a great party trick
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,All kidding aside
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,I heard its common
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,but not from the a reputable source is it true that for MSers
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,changes in weather can cause headaches
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,Do weather changes affect the nerves that much
sc33n0,t5_2s23e,What are your symptoms when the pressure changes
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Post COVID brain MRI results
rxo169,t5_2s23e, yr of MS was honestly sweating a bit and did not know what to expect
rxo169,t5_2s23e,I got hit with covid back at the end of October
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Literally the day before I was supposed to get my Tysabri infusion
rxo169,t5_2s23e,So it pushed my infusion out to past seven weeks
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Because right after I got over it my wife popped positive
rxo169,t5_2s23e,managed to make it through little over two weeks of me being sick
rxo169,t5_2s23e,but it finally got her
rxo169,t5_2s23e,So that tacked more time onto not being able to get infused
rxo169,t5_2s23e,So right now Im thankful that despite all the trauma and inflammation
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Brain is all clear
rxo169,t5_2s23e,At least physically
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Cant claim psychological all clear lol
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Brain fog and speech problems galore
rxo169,t5_2s23e,FWIW my worst symptoms were F fever
rxo169,t5_2s23e,probably a bit of pneumonia
rxo169,t5_2s23e,and horrendous body aches mixed with constant exhaustion far above normal MS driven
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Kept an eye on O and it never seemed to go below  and that was only after ascending stairs
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Within a minute it was back to  or 
rxo169,t5_2s23e,I did pop a lot of C
rxo169,t5_2s23e,and some meds after day six I think
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Week one wasnt totally horrible
rxo169,t5_2s23e,about like a rough flu
rxo169,t5_2s23e,That day eight or nine is when it hit hard and did not know how bad it was going to get
rxo169,t5_2s23e,The second week was abhorrent
rxo169,t5_2s23e,The people I got it from had it much much worse
rxo169,t5_2s23e,but also are mending well
rxo169,t5_2s23e,Also prayed a lot and tried to stay positive not that I was always successful
rxo169,t5_2s23e,I hope this gives someone hope
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,Study with Twins Untangles Environmental and Genetic Influences on MS Summary A study of monozygotic twins allowed researchers to discover which parts of immune dysfunction in multiple sclerosis were influenced by genetics
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,and which were influenced by environmental factors
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,  Researchers at the University of Zurich and Munichs LMU Klinikum hospital have studied the immune system of pairs of monozygotic twins to identify the influence of the environment and of genetics in cases of multiple sclerosis
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,In the process
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,they may have discovered precursor cells of the disease-causing T cells
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,Genetic predisposition alone does not lead to MS  Studies in recent years have clearly shown that genetic risk variants are a necessary condition for developing multiple sclerosis
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,Based on our study
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,we were able to show that about half of the composition of our immune system is determined by genetics
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,says Florian Ingelfinger
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,candidate at the UZH Institute of Experimental Immunology
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,the researchers recruited  pairs of monozygotic twins where one twin is affected by MS and the co-twin is healthy
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,From a genetic point of view
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,the twins were thus identical
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,Although the healthy twins also had the maximum genetic risk for MS
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,they showed no clinical signs of the disease
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,says Lisa Ann Gerdes
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,Thanks to this globally unique cohort of identical twins
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,the researchers were able to exclude genetic influences by comparing twins with and without multiple sclerosis
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,  We are exploring the central question of how the immune system of two genetically identical individuals leads to significant inflammation and massive nerve damage in one case
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,and no damage at all in the other
svoqw8,t5_2s23e, explains Burkhard Becher
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,Using identical twins enabled the international team of scientists to rule out the genetic influence and specifically track the immune system changes that were ultimately responsible for triggering MS in one twin
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,we found the biggest differences in the immune profiles of MS affected twins in to be in the cytokine receptors
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,the way immune cells communicate with one another
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,The cytokine network is like the language of the immune system
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,The researchers found that increased sensitivity to certain cytokines leads to greater activation of T cells in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,These T cells are more likely to migrate into the central nervous system of patients and cause damage there
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,The identified cells were found to have the characteristics of recently activated cells
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,which were in the process of developing into fully functional T cells
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,We may have discovered the cellular big bang of MS hereprecursor cells that give rise to disease-causing T cells
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,  The findings of this study are particularly valuable in comparison to previous studies of MS which do not control for genetic predisposition
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,says Burkhard Becher
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,We are thus able to find out which part of the immune dysfunction in MS is influenced by genetic components and which by environmental factors
svoqw8,t5_2s23e,This is of fundamental importance in understanding the development of the disease
snagvm,t5_2r876,just want to vent a lil digestion issues
snagvm,t5_2r876,  im honestly just so tired
snagvm,t5_2r876,im lucky enough to have never struggled with gaining weight
snagvm,t5_2r876,even though i am severely pancreatic insufficient
snagvm,t5_2r876,and i have no idea why
snagvm,t5_2r876,and i want to make it EXTREMELY CLEAR that i am not saying i wish i was sicker
snagvm,t5_2r876,or doing that thing people do where theyre like youre so lucky that you can eat whatever you want  however
snagvm,t5_2r876,im just really struggling with my gut health and my weight
snagvm,t5_2r876,even though i dont struggle with being underweight
snagvm,t5_2r876,my stomach still just always feels bad
snagvm,t5_2r876,i am always bloated
snagvm,t5_2r876,always have literal just greasy huge shits
snagvm,t5_2r876,and always just feel kinda sick to my stomach
snagvm,t5_2r876,i realize so many have it much worse
snagvm,t5_2r876,but i am still just kinda struggling right now 
snagvm,t5_2r876,i havent been able to take my enzymes for  year im  btw because of severe pill swallowing anxiety
snagvm,t5_2r876,so thats probably why im like this
snagvm,t5_2r876,but it still just really sucks because im just so tired of always feeling like i just ate  taco bell boxes
snagvm,t5_2r876,in regards to my weight
snagvm,t5_2r876,im just having the typical teenage struggle with body image
snagvm,t5_2r876,and all that fun jazz
snagvm,t5_2r876,i am overweight
snagvm,t5_2r876,which is obviously a blessing for someone who has cf
snagvm,t5_2r876,but it still is tough to deal with as a teenager
snagvm,t5_2r876,im pretty sure its also exacerbated by the fact that i still get ravenously hungry and tend to binge eat
snagvm,t5_2r876,but for whatever reason my body is still able to gain weight despite obvious malabsorption
snagvm,t5_2r876,idek why i made this post
snagvm,t5_2r876,i guess i just wanted to vent and see if anyone has ever felt anything similar
snagvm,t5_2r876,i dont really have close friends
snagvm,t5_2r876,and no one at school knows i have cf
snagvm,t5_2r876,so i cant even talk to acquaintances about it
snagvm,t5_2r876,and i cant talk to my family about it because they just try to make me feel guilty about not taking pills even though i want to and i genuinely have no idea how to at this point
snagvm,t5_2r876,thanks for listening if you got this far 
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,Pain  meds during pregnancybreastfeeding Hi all
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,Were slowly trying to get ready for a pregnancy and I have spent the last decade living under the assumption that you could take Tylenol acetaminophen while trying to conceive
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,pregnant and lactating
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,I learned today that the latest studies suggest otherwise
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,And Im taking it daily a small dose to manage my pain
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,otherwise I cant sleep
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,It was either this or opioids
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,so I went with Tylenol
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,Apart from that
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,at the moment I take only Plaquenil
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,Ladies who have been pregnant with lupus
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,how did you manage your pain for me
rlkfyw,t5_2rtve,Im talking specifically about the muscle pain and chest pain

s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Does anyone elses autoantibody levels jump all over the map
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Like a variety across several years
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Cliff notes my dsDNA lowered after starting medicine
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,my lupus nephritis is improving too
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,but Im now testing positive for other lupus autoantibodies that Ive never had before
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Has this happened to anyone else
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Background   years ago when I went into near kidney failure from lupus
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,my dsDNA was slightly elevated but my anti Smith was quite high over 
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Positive for RNP but negative for the RoLa antibodies
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Fast forward  months  starting benlysta
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,my dsDNA went to negative and my anti Smith levels dropped  to 
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Other antibodies stayed the same so that was positive
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Now fast forward another - months
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,my kidneys are improving but other symptoms are starting
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,DsDNA is still negative
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,the anti Smith is exactly the same 
s9jik8,t5_2rtve, vs  but my Ro  La antibodies are now POSITIVE
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,and quite high
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,its so funny cuz I thought this flare feels different than others and the blood work now shows AABs I havent had before
s9jik8,t5_2rtve,Talking to rheumy next week about results but just wondering others experiences

ruf891,t5_2s1h9,Feel like your neurologist doesnt believe you
ruf891,t5_2s1h9,So I previously posted about weird seizure dreams and landed in the hospital last night
ruf891,t5_2s1h9,Now I know this is weird as Im having full body convulsions but Im aware its happening and not blacking out
ruf891,t5_2s1h9,I spoke to  neurologists last night and felt like they didnt really believe me
ruf891,t5_2s1h9,Ive cycled a lot of meds dues to bad reaction and difficult to control focal seizures but damn sometimes it feels like they dont believe anything I tell them
ruf891,t5_2s1h9,Im very introverted and reserved but does anyone ever confront their doctor about this
sjpk76,t5_2s3g1,Progress and hope for others Hi guys
sjpk76,t5_2s3g1,I was diagnosed with ibs back in May and I believe it was due to months of extremely high stress

sjpk76,t5_2s3g1,which I believed helped me heal
sjpk76,t5_2s3g1,I used to have to follow a strict low fodmap diet and still was barely surviving but now I can eat everything except large quantities of onion
sjpk76,t5_2s3g1,and black beans and have little symptoms
sjpk76,t5_2s3g1,I just wanted to post my improvements so as to maybe give others hope

rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,Happened again Last night i was extremely stressed because of work
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,a co worker is  and behaves like a damn teenager
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,I come in after she has worked and the place is a mess and it pisses me off
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,well tonight i finally notified the boss about it and she said she would fix it
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,But the damage was done
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,or should i say way early this morning I had an attack
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,Twice one right after another
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,each one was a couple minutes long
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,Yes after the holidays are over I plan on going to see a doctor
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,Ive had it with this shit
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,this morning i still dont feel right in my head
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,floaty and fatigued
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,the worse part is not having some one there to comfort me during and after
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,i already live with bpd and major depressive disorder so its already hard
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,I have one more appt with the disability paid docs then have to wait forever more to hear them tell me i can adapt
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,i have a legat rep
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,but no faith
rptoz7,t5_2s1h9,Including my appeals

owi6ws,t5_2r876,When my kid got diagnosed at weeks old I felt a lot of things but one thing was a lot of anger that we hadnt been screened before pregnancy to know we had these genes or during pregnancy so I could mentally prepare beforehand
owi6ws,t5_2r876,I saw someone on here say their SO was in nd trimester when they found out their daughter would be born with CF
owi6ws,t5_2r876,Is this something you only get privately
owi6ws,t5_2r876,I wanted  kids cause I hated being an only child but now Im scared about making another child suffer
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Feeling a little hopeless
sxw561,t5_2saq9,I started having symptoms about a year ago had to quit my job in April 
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Got officially diagnosed with POTS a few months after by a specialist in my area
sxw561,t5_2saq9,We have tried  medications with side effects that Im not able to live with
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Propranalol gives me severe nauseadizzyness with the addition of skin flaking  scalp itching
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Ivabradine I had an allergic reaction to
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Midodrine caused some pretty bad back pain along with the same skin flaking  scalp itching as Propranalol
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Saline infusion did nothing
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Im drinking water with hydration add-ins
sxw561,t5_2saq9,whatever is handy at the moment
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Ive been waiting for  weeks almost for the place my wheelchair prescription was sent to to call me so I can pick it up
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Im thinking of asking my husband to go with me today to get it because the Doctors office I go to said people usually just walk in with the RX and are confused about why they are giving me the runaround
sxw561,t5_2saq9,I just feel like
sxw561,t5_2saq9,with  medications crossed off the list
sxw561,t5_2saq9,theres not much I can do in order to be able to manage the symptoms
sxw561,t5_2saq9,I have a stool in the kitchen
sxw561,t5_2saq9,I sit to shower
sxw561,t5_2saq9,I go to physical therapy and have been doing the exercises at home
sxw561,t5_2saq9,I just feel so out of options right now
sxw561,t5_2saq9,The specialist is going to hopefully get in contact about a th medication to try
sxw561,t5_2saq9,Just a little rant I guess
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,Constant pain in the lower right abdomen I had constant pain in the last  months
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,Ive been diagnosed with IBS but
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,to be honest
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,I cant completely identify myself with the standard symptoms
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,The pain is located in the right lower abdomen
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,I would say is in the Illeocecal area or ascending colon
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,The thing about this pain is that is not completely relieved after going to the bathroom
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,It stays like a muted and dull pain
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,It feels like when you recuperate after surgery when the area is inflamed
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,This may be because of the inflammation or irritation of the bowel I presume
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,I can count the number of times without any type of sensation in the area
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night I still feel it when Im laying on my back
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,but curiously is lower when I lay on my left side
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,It is also painful when doing exercises that compress that area
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,Ive tried a number of remedies with more or less success peppermint oil
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1, but it is never going away and always returns
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,Can grow depending on my bowel activity but it goes down to a latent feeling
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,Im checking with the doctors but they insist is IBS after all tests
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,and I had a lot of them CT
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,blood test in many ways
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,  Is there anyone out there who can identify with this story
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,Or somebody who can help me explain this pain
svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,The worst part of all this for me is the anxiety

rtzsrf,t5_2syer,Gout and COVID I am at DAY  since my first symptom of COVID
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,Im vaccinated and Im recovering well
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,My symptoms were an extreme sore throat
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,fever off and on and a bit of a cough
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,Im feeling almost recovered except for the most painful gout flare up I have ever experienced
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,I have had general aching on the side of my foot before
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,normally not enough pain that I couldnt get out of bed
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,Im worried I may be on my way to that
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,I have a hot spot on the outer top of my foot and in the last hour it feels like a spike is coming in from sole of my foot
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,Im have been on Indo for three days and Im trying to drink as much water as possible
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,Im not looking for anything in particular
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,but I think this was definitely a result of my body reacting to COVID
rtzsrf,t5_2syer,I hope it starts getting better soon

scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,Am I going through something
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,some background  Ive always experienced sleep paralysis as a child
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,as i grew up
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,it only got worse
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,from being choked to exploding head syndrome to feeling pressure on my organs
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,for the past year or two Ive been diagonsed with OCD
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,a week ago during a nap mostly when most sleep paralysis occurs to me I was covered in my blanket including head
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,sleeping on my side
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,I open my eyes and realise that Im having another sleep paralysis episode
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,but now there is something different
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,i look around and realise im in my aunts room that i used to visit and sleep on frequently during my childhood
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,however this got me excited since I thought I can lucid dream
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,I take a look around only to take a 
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2, second glance of a shadowy figure
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,I quickly turn my head back not to look at it as I Instantly realised what this figure is sleep paralysis demon
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,it held my hands
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,prevented me from talking by choking me and said non-existant mumbling of words to me
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,but since I had plenty of experience with sleep paralysis I was able to overpower it by waking myself up
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,while waking up I find my eyes are open
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,I zoom out from a piece of my blanket like how a camera changes its focus while blurring
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,and I realize all of this was a hullicnations just from the simple shapes and colors on that small piece
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,fast forward today the same thing happened today
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,while taking a nap I keep imagining scenes and have intrusive thoughts
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,while picturing a seen i was imagining a little girl with her mom doing random things dont really remember why i did this or the context now here is how my ocd comes into play
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,my ocd is tellingmaking me imagine that girl in a scary way
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,like with shadow head and eyes or something like that
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,i struggle with my slef not to but my ocd gets the last shot
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,after picturing the girl how my ocd described me or made me fear of imagining it in a more accurate way
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,it was not voices and i know its ocd and its intrusive thoughts not something else i slightlysomewhat shock in fear from how imagined the girl looks
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,a few seconds later
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,i wake up in my blanket with the same scenario as before only to see that the lights that were on a few seconds ago were off
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,i didnt realise what was happening until I woke up
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,i concluded from that
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,that i was having the same thing execpt i fortunately didnt notice the sleep paralysis demon or didnt even come to me at the time
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,however when i woke up
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,the lights of the room were actually on
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,could all of this because i am unaware of having scary intrusive thoughts before sleepepisode
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,I tell myself that its ok since sleep paralysis  is a pretty common phenomena and plenty of ordinary people experience it
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,however what got me slightly more worried is for the past  days is whenever im in a dark room i keep imaginingseeing every shadow as something scary or a frigheting dark figure
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,like you know in the cartoons when the kids turn the lights off and see everything as a scary figure
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,its like that but somewhat different
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,i keep turning on my flashlight on those things to check what they are
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,could it be my subconsious having trajma from what happend earlier or something else
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,or Am i panicking
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,honestly one thing I learnt about mental disorders is to be suspicous of anything unusual to detect it at its early development for much easier cure
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,what do you think of this
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,are there any other details you want me to give out
scjyzt,t5_2tyg2,Thanks in adavance

sesu9v,t5_2r876,Just a quick question about hypertension
sesu9v,t5_2r876,After I noticed a hypertension at the doc office back in november never really cared about it I decided to buy a home blood pressure device in order to check it daily
sesu9v,t5_2r876,In december my daily checks returned   in the morning and  in the evening on a daily basis
sesu9v,t5_2r876,Sometimes even waking up with  systolic
sesu9v,t5_2r876,I have   drugs for hypertension Ramipril and Amlodipine that I take in the evening right before bed
sesu9v,t5_2r876,With the above values my docs told me to increase Amlodipine to mg a day
sesu9v,t5_2r876,And now my figures have gone to  in the morning and ish in the evening
sesu9v,t5_2r876,I think I cant get a normal blood pressure with  years transplant
sesu9v,t5_2r876, years diabetes
sesu9v,t5_2r876, years chronic rejection
sesu9v,t5_2r876,kidneys leaking proteins and  years with CF etc
sesu9v,t5_2r876,But I would be interested to know how you deal with high blood pressure and if it is a concern for you
sesu9v,t5_2r876,Or maybe from what values it starts to be a concern for your team
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,Cold sore and flare
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,Im currently in the midst of my skip week after  loading doses of kesimpta
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,Today I woke up with a big swollen bottom corner of my lip
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,which seems to be the start of a cold sore
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,But also since I woke up today
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,my ms symptoms feel significantly worse
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,but much more intense than Ive felt them in months increased numbness especially
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,Has anyone experienced something similar
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,Is it something to call the doctor about or just keep an eye on
sd9w5i,t5_2s23e,Thanks for the help
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Doctor suggesting delaying treatment
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Im still relatively new here and looking to get some input on my specific situation
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Last year I had an episode of numbness and tingling on my left side arm and leg
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,It went away after about  days
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,but the incident kick-started a long line of tests which ended up in my MS diagnosis
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,I have - demyelinating brain lesions visible on MRI
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,All spinal MRIs were clear
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,I saw an MS specialist who said that only spinal lesions would cause symptoms in the extremities
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,This means that my MS lesions in my brain did not cause my numbnesstingling and have not caused any symptoms yet
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,The doctor said that because of this
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,treatment can be delayed
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,and I would be monitored every six months or so with an MRI
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,This is an MS specialist doctor with a reputable clinic
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Is there any merit to this approach in your view
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Obviously the idea of delaying these medications is appealing
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,but I also know its playing with fire
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Its frustrating because in general I have always been averse to taking medication
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,so what this doctor said what pretty much what I wanted to hear
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,I dont want to be unwise and risk unneeded damage
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,but I also wonder if this is in fact radiologically isolated syndrome
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,which to my understanding is supposed to be monitored before treatment starts
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Im just a little stuck on this
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Any insight or input would be much appreciated
s1qscl,t5_2s23e,Thank you guys

sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,Can you help me please
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,I feel almost normal standing on the spot and going for a walk with my father when its around  degrees in the UK
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,No heavy feeling in my shoulders and aching headache
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,head pressure or significant increase in my sympathetic nervous system
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,Just relaxation and calm for the most part
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,Cold is a vasoconstrictor isnt it
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,Is it doing anything else to my physiology like increasing nitrous oxide
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,Ive tried so many beta blockers
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,snris etc and theyve done very little for my orthostatic symptoms
sh4gn2,t5_2saq9,FYI my orthostatic symptoms are more HYPERtension rather than HYPO

s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,I think my friend has psychosis
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,how to help them TW Scide   Hey guys
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Ive recently learned that one of my friends has been experiencing symptoms that seem a lot like psychosis
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,They recently survived a scide attempt by overdose about a month ago
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,and since then my friends and I have been encouraging them to seek mental health support
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,They told me that they had signed up for the waiting list for receiving psychiatric help
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,however their roommate recently told me that they actually havent done this since they believe that they will get brain damage if they see a psychiatrist or therapist
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Their roommates are the only people theyve told about this belief
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,the roommate I talked to has also told me that my friend will send messages or say things indicating that theyll get help
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,but then have no recollection of ever saying such things
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,The roommate I talked to has been trying his best to support them
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,but hes feeling pretty overwhelmed at the moment
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,and is feeling traumatized about the whole situation
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,no less since he was the one to provide them with the medication that they overdosed on
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,and I think he also just doesnt really know how to deal with this kind of situation
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,He suggested a support hotline to them on multiple occasions
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,but my friend is adamant that they arent helpful
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Do you guys have any suggestions about how I could best support my friend
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Do you guys think theyre experiencing psychosis
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Is trying to encourage them to seek psychiatric help the best way to go about this
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,If so how would I go about convincing them to do it
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Will it be necessary to tell them that I suspect they have psychosis at some point
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,I look forward to your suggestions
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Please let me know if I used any insensitive language when talking about this situation
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,and I apologize for any displays of ignorance haha
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,Thank you guys for hearing me out
s3sizf,t5_2tyg2,I look forward to your suggestions

sf56xs,t5_2tyg2,it is as if someone has just told me my entire family has just died or something
sf56xs,t5_2tyg2,even though they have not
sf56xs,t5_2tyg2,it is the most raw intense evil feeling the worst possible thing has just happened to me but i cant think of what it is
sf56xs,t5_2tyg2,the thought of living for another second makes me feel ill
sf56xs,t5_2tyg2,the feeling is so strong that if i move i will scream
sf56xs,t5_2tyg2,last time this happened it didnt last long but it was followed by delusions and hallucinations so i am wondering if it is related to psychosis
sf56xs,t5_2tyg2,has anyone else experienced this  dw i am not going to end my life i am unable to 
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,I had a severe paranoid psychosis a few years with intens hallucinations
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,So during my psychosis i had a very strong reaction to music
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,some songs brought me straight into trance
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,I had these eleborate conversations with imaginary friends but also amazing D orgasms
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,One time i had to stop driving cause a song on the radio made me orgasm
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,I drove without music after that
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,When i was home alone
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,i let those hallucinations run their course often because they were so freaking pleasant
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,I often hear about scary and threatening voices
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,mine were hypersexual and very friendly
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,I had a hard time leaving them behind
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,It was confusing
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,i didnt want to take meds because i was paranoid but also because i didnt wanna loose the good trances
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,Im glad i found the strength to live in reality again
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,im making a list of those triggersongs
s0iayq,t5_2tyg2,ive been listening to them and slowly reminiscing about what happened

rzpw1o,t5_2qlaa,I had few onion rings last night with my dinner
rzpw1o,t5_2qlaa,But I had what I believe to be acid spitting up into my throat causing that horrible tickle in the throat
rzpw1o,t5_2qlaa,I tried to eliminate it with some Gaviscon which sort of helped
rzpw1o,t5_2qlaa,I went to sleep and then I woke up with the same horrible acidy tickle and started coughing

spo5yf,t5_2s23e,Newly Diagnosed and Looking for Advice on Choosing a DMT Hi everyone
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,I recently joined this group after being diagnosed with RRMS a few weeks ago
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,I had my first appointment with my MS specialist today since being in the hospital and we began to discuss treatment options
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,Being in grad school
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,we took injectables off the table pretty quickly because of my schedule
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,They recommended oral meds
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,and Im hesitant to jump straight to infusions
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,After reading some of the side effects and relapses people have had after stopping Gilenya though
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,Im really freaked out and dont know what to think
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,My symptoms have been really mild so far
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,but according to my MRI
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,Ive had MS for a couple years now and it took a case of ON to be discovered
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,Any advice on which DMT to choose
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,sorry for the late update
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,Im overwhelmed and so thankful for all of your responses
spo5yf,t5_2s23e,what my insurance would cover ended up driving my decision

spo5yf,t5_2s23e,Thank yall again
p46c5f,t5_2syer,Accidental switch to Febuxostat from Allopurinol I changed doctors after moving city
p46c5f,t5_2syer,I showed all my medications by name and said Id like to continue with my gout medication
p46c5f,t5_2syer,My purine level is now in normal range but I was thinking I would switch to less dosage
p46c5f,t5_2syer,He gave me a prescription and I didnt think much of it
p46c5f,t5_2syer,I noticed he said something different but i thought it was a similar enough drug or generic version
p46c5f,t5_2syer,After researching Im finding febuxostat should only be used if allopurinol does not work
p46c5f,t5_2syer,Should I stop taking allopurinol and start febuxostat or go back to discuss with my doctor another time
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,Can someone share some of the challenges being in a relationship with a CF partner and how you successfully manage them
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,Ive been in a relationship with my boyfriend for a few months and I fell in love with him almost a few weeks in but I have not muttered up the courage to tell him yet
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,We are both in our s and in America
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,He told me about his CF and his lung transplant from the beginning
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,I fell in love with him quickly and felt like I never had this strong of a connection with anyone
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,Yet I cannot tell him I love you
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,The main reason is that I have been feeling heavy about the fact that he might die in  years and the thought of that has made me cry way too many times
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,And I find myself looking for reasons to doubt the relationship
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,I was able to manage those episodes but its getting too much to bear
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,I am thinking to talk to him about the future lifedeathhealth caremoneykids but am afraid of it might be too much
p9tv3l,t5_2r876,So I am here asking for help

rylejd,t5_2s1h9,crazy fast testing So kinda weird question for anyone else likely from Canada I got booked in for a  day monitoring starting November 
rylejd,t5_2s1h9,I had been on a wait list for maybe - months which isnt bad
rylejd,t5_2s1h9,Now I know some can be COVID related for cancelations but between that EEG and January  Ive been booked for so much
rylejd,t5_2s1h9,During the first  days I had  spect scans
rylejd,t5_2s1h9, CT and then January I had my pet scan and mri
rylejd,t5_2s1h9,Now I got a call for the neurophysicologist test that I was told was going to take quite a while
rylejd,t5_2s1h9,Im a little nervous that out of nowhere Ive been given amounts of testing that can sometimes take into a year to get done
rylejd,t5_2s1h9,The EEG showed I have a different type of epilepsy than first thought but it still seems crazy to me
rylejd,t5_2s1h9,Has anyone ever been pushed through so fast
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,My tips for Gout from a family of gout sufferers on both sides of my family unfortunately
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,I have an anova Sous-vide cooker which can run up to a L tub of water with immersion pump
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,heating coil and accurate temp control so tipping kettle hot water into a tub wont risk burns
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,HEAT over an extended period to the point I call my sous-vide the foot cooker spare since they sent me a replacement after my original unit failed to firmware update   So
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,I used my spare unit for gout to heat a tub of hot water
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,C plus to keep the joint warm for a few hours while pounding water and vitamin C  other remedies along with NSAIDs since honestly if you get onto just NSAIDs before it gets bad it really cuts the recovery time down
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,heat and vitamin C  tart cherry juice helps but heat and NSAIDs are the best advice I can give
rgfh8n,t5_2syer,Heat is easily obtained with a cheap sous-vide and a bucket  plastic tub

pu2nl2,t5_2r876,No motivation for treatments Diagnosed late Ive just recently got on reddit so bear with me
pu2nl2,t5_2r876, I was diagnosed at the age of 
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,I wouldve been diagnosed at birth  but my state didnt start doing CF birth screenings until 
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,As a child I had a constant dry cough
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,and got constant lung infections
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,I went to my primary physician and got an x-ray of my chest and they immediately sent me to a specialist where I later went on to get diagnosed
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,Getting diagnosed at that age made things very hard
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,I grew up thinking I was a healthy child and then everything changed quite literally
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,Ever since then
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,Ive always struggled with finding the motivation for doing my treatments
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,I never coughed anything up
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,and Ive rarely felt truly sick
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,I havent been hospitalized in about  years either
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,My parents and relatives always down played my diagnosis by saying I have a mild case of CF
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,That didnt help with the motivation at all
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,Im on Trikafta and it has made my symptoms basically unnoticeable
pu2nl2,t5_2r876,Im wondering if anyone else has had the same experience or could give me advice on how to find motivation to keep myself staying healthy
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,How do we get the transition to community support right
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,This is for anyone who has had an episode of psychosis which led to a hospital admission and were then linked up with a community mental health team once you were discharged in the UK
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,Having left hospital which in itself
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,regardless of the experiences you were having at the time
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,can be a traumatic experience  
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,What was it like transitioning to a community mental health team
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,good and bad 
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,What could have made this experience better
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,Is there any information that you learnt later down the line which when you look back you wish had been shared with you during this transition
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,If you are someone who didnt engage with with your community mental health team
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,please could you share your reasons for this
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,There are quite a few questions here so if you wish to respond please dont feel any pressure to respond to all of them
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,any insight you can give me will be very useful
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,Thank you in advance to those of you who do respond
s5d3sk,t5_2tyg2,I know talking about this time can be particularly challenging so I am very grateful for any insight you can provide
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,For those who developed pychosis using weed
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,Im close with someone who smoked for five years
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,I was present the first two and always thought he really benefitted from consuming
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,he used to be a very anxious guy and that gave him some centering and creativity
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,but it was after a rought year that he began using more everyday that eventually started the symptoms  Would you say if you had microdose or use less often result had been different
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,in other words was it the quantity and prolonged use the cause or you think something inherent to the substances in weed is what triggers it
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,I guess every root cause of pshycosis has its different ways of treating it
s3d4vt,t5_2tyg2,what have you found to be helpful alleviating symptoms of the weed induced
sactga,t5_2tyg2,how do you guys differentiate between whats real and whats not
sactga,t5_2tyg2,to preface this ive been diagnosed with major depression with psychosis
sactga,t5_2tyg2,i have experienced paranoia and delusions and have some issues with hallucinations
sactga,t5_2tyg2,for at least over a month now ive been smelling chemicals in my apartment
sactga,t5_2tyg2,its started out coming from the fridgefreezer
sactga,t5_2tyg2,everytime anyone opened it i live with  other people i could smell an overwhelming smell of chemicals
sactga,t5_2tyg2,like spray paintnail polish remover
sactga,t5_2tyg2,from my googling i can only find it would be freon
sactga,t5_2tyg2,i kept bringing it up but everyone else denys being able to smell anything
sactga,t5_2tyg2,now i dont smell it from the fridgefreezer anymore
sactga,t5_2tyg2,i now smell it constantly throughout the house
sactga,t5_2tyg2,it comes and goes every few minutes mostly and when i open the front door to enter the house from running errands its all i can smell
sactga,t5_2tyg2,everyone else denies smelling anything
sactga,t5_2tyg2,im freaking out because freon is dangerous
sactga,t5_2tyg2,i smell it all the time and its disgusting and no one will do anything because they dont smell it
sactga,t5_2tyg2,im wondering if im just hallucinating again
sactga,t5_2tyg2,i feel like its not likely because its been going on consistently for so long
sactga,t5_2tyg2,its scaring me and i dont know what to do because i dont know if its all in my head but no one canwill do anything because they cant smell it so they arent concerned
sactga,t5_2tyg2,how tf am i supposed to tell if this is all in my head or not
s2cumb,t5_2s23e,Lumbar Puncture Aftereffects So I went in for a lumbar puncture two days ago having been told by my neurology consultant all I needed for a MS diagnoses was a blood test and a lumbar puncture since the MRI scans found  lesions and after  attempts I tapped out and we rescheduled for March
s2cumb,t5_2s23e,Now since I got back from the hospital light
s2cumb,t5_2s23e,pretty much any light source
s2cumb,t5_2s23e,causes me to develop a very painful headache and retreat to a dark room with no lights on
s2cumb,t5_2s23e,Now I know headaches are common after lumbar punctures but this has knocked me out and Im wondering if anyone has had anything similar happen to them

rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,Vaping cannabis post-tifnissen surgery
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,Most TIF surgery post-op instructions simply say to not smoke
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,I understand thats the best bet
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,but I enjoy vaping every now and then
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,and I want to understand what my realistic expectations are if I get the surgery
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,Im curious if infrequently vaping cannabis a few times a week
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,no tobacco is detrimental to the structure
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa, weeks out of the surgery
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,Does anyone have any experience
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,Is this something I can safely resume if I wait the allotted time after the surgery
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,Im not too interested in ediblesI do enjoy them too
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,but Id like to specifically know if anyones casually vaped after their surgery has  healed
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,and if its caused any issues
rkyp7r,t5_2qlaa,I do believe that cannabis effects my acid reflux

scfjqp,t5_2r876,I need insight from fellow patients Hello
scfjqp,t5_2r876,I have started working with my CF clinic in a group of patients trying to improve clinic experience and attendance
scfjqp,t5_2r876,One of the things they have been focused on is patient engagement and having patients come to appointments
scfjqp,t5_2r876,I just joined this group but apparently a lot of patients havent been coming to clinic
scfjqp,t5_2r876,I am curious  What makes you come to your appointments
scfjqp,t5_2r876,If you dont go to appointments regularly
scfjqp,t5_2r876,what would have you go
scfjqp,t5_2r876,an incentive you might like
scfjqp,t5_2r876,  What makes you like your clinic
scfjqp,t5_2r876,If you are aware of your clinics attendance
scfjqp,t5_2r876,how is it
scfjqp,t5_2r876,And any other information that could be helpful regarding attendance would be great
scfjqp,t5_2r876,I want to be able to help our clinic
scfjqp,t5_2r876,and ultimately other CF patients
scfjqp,t5_2r876,so any insight would be fantastic
scfjqp,t5_2r876,edited to add another question
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,After six years my neurologist is taking me off Keppra because of the rage
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,and putting me on  Zonisamide
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,Of course
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,Ive read the official reviews
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,but Im wondering about peoples real life experiences
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,Anyone been on  Zonisamide
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,And what did you think
s0oc2z,t5_2s1h9,Were talking just  milligrams a day once we get up to that level

s3yvel,t5_2s23e,Panicked in the MRI Machine and Now Im Pissed Headline says it all
s3yvel,t5_2s23e,Didnt get anything accomplished and had to walk away
s3yvel,t5_2s23e,Very upset with myself and angry that I wasted valuable MRI time for others
s3yvel,t5_2s23e,Ive done braincervical MRIs twice before and done okay
s3yvel,t5_2s23e,doesnt prescribe me sedatives because of a history in my chart of overusing Xanax twelve years ago when I was in college
s3yvel,t5_2s23e,I went to a different imaging location this time and the different machine just threw me
s3yvel,t5_2s23e,Next time I will do better
qfxl83,t5_2rtve,Could this be malar rash
qfxl83,t5_2rtve,Will post other symptoms below
qfxl83,t5_2rtve,Im pretty sure its lupus but curious about my facial redness
qfxl83,t5_2rtve,Ive had one Dr a young resident brush it off as sunburn but I dont think it is
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,One of the reasons I hate living in the US Ive been on Mayzent since July and have been getting it through the same mail-order pharmacy this entire time
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,Because my husbands job offers horrible insurance
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,we decided to get it through the Healthcare marketplace Obamacare this year
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,Despite the fact that it is the same insurance company as before
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,and even says the name of the mail-order pharmacy Ive been using right on the front of the insurance card
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,my insurance does not cover any medications through that pharmacy
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,After getting the run-around between my insurance and the pharmacy
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,as well as  other pharmacies
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,I finally found the only one they cover for this type of medication
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,Ive been on the phone with them every day for a week now and they still havent filled my order
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,They said it takes awhile to process the copay assistance if I dont want to pay thousands of dollars
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,I have been off my Mazent for  days now as a result
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,And it really sucks because Im seeing my neuro the first week of February and hes taking me off Mayzent
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,so its like Im fighting for nothing
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,But I obviously dont feel safe going off of it without having another DMT lined up
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,considering one of the side effects of stoping Mayzent is severe worsening of MS
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,  This is the same bs I went through every single year when I was on Copaxone
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,Except now Im a SAHM to a  year old and I dont have the time or energy to spend hours upon hours each day trying to track down the right person to talk to at each insurancepharmacy
s6lpy3,t5_2s23e,I really hate this countrys healthcare system
rrtn4b,t5_2rtve,Age  I had non hodgkins lymphoma

rrtn4b,t5_2rtve,Ive read up a lot about late term effects of chemo
rrtn4b,t5_2rtve,I am now in my s  Lupus symptoms started late teens early s but didnt get diagnosed til a year ago
rrtn4b,t5_2rtve,Im wondering if anyone else has history of chemo and then autoimmune after chemo
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,Tiredin despair of seeing my father in that state I am 
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,my father has MS and I started showing signs at the age of 
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,got the diagnosis at  and was supposed to start medication at 
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,He had relapsing-remitting and now has the progressive type
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,doctors have told him theres no treatment available for his own type
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,only one thats experimental
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,so he takes nothing
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,It has been horrible to see him sick throughout childhoodteenagehood
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,It became hopelessness and despair when I learned I had the same BS
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I was and am angry at him
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I believe he shouldnt have had me
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,Growing up with a sick parent is traumatic enough getting the same BS is unspeakably traumatic
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I dont think he should have risked giving me this kind of life
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,Sometimes I wonder if Im looking at my future
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,if all this hell Ive seen is whats coming for me
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,and I think its highly likely
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,because we got the same genes
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I think Ill get the same stuff
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,that Ill be impacted the same way andI dont want to
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I dont want to
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,In all those years
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I havent met a single person with MS whos doing well
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,The only ones Ive met are the ones I saw in hospitals
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,given they were hospitalized werent okay at all
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,This has created a mindset of pointlessness
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,because the reality Ive seen is that even people who did stay on meds and followed through
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,So I fail to keep up with medication
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I take it some days
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,then I go like
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I see him
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,and its like lifes telling me
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,remember this isnt a cure
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,you are going to suffer either way
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,and then I skip meds
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,Sometime I start them again
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,then I stop again
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,Seeing my father damages me in a huge way
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,And Im seeing him daily
sdchbn,t5_2s23e,I dont have the option to get out of here

ruqfnt,t5_2s1h9,Had a seizure last night Had my rd seizure last night and also tested positive for covid this morning
ruqfnt,t5_2s1h9,My neurologist said that the seizure was most likely caused by covid because the other two ive had were both caused by vaping and i handt had one since march  before last night
ruqfnt,t5_2s1h9,So if you do get covid stay aware that it could trigger epilepsy
ruqfnt,t5_2s1h9,Honestly think this one will be the worst one for my mental state if they dont let me drive because i didnt even do anything this time to cause it
ruqfnt,t5_2s1h9,Ill have to suffer consequences for something completely out of my control
ruqfnt,t5_2s1h9,I know some of yoy probably have it way worse then me but i just needed a place to vent bc i feel like the people around me dont really understand how it fucks you up mentally

sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,F ive had problems with my stomach for over two years now
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,but honestly its gotten so much worse from november onwards
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,i mainly suffer with nausea and diarrhoea
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,it often gets worse at night time
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,but sometimes it just comes out of the blue
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,ive been kept awake
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,been missing school and declining offers to stay over in my friends houses over it
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,i got bloods taken and a stool sample done
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,and both came back clear
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,ive been put down to be seen by general paediatrics within the next - weeks since im still a minor
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,ive been given nothing other than just to take probiotics and get buscopan
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,both my mother and my sister suffer with ibs
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,so i was thinking it might be something like that
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,i dont really know if its related
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,but sometimes i might feel a bit lightheaded or i start shaking like crazy whenever i start to feel nauseous
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,it just starts off with nausea
sjzdu9,t5_2s3g1,shaking and then diarrhoea
s8wgdo,t5_2saq9,Change in blood pressure when standing

s8wgdo,t5_2saq9,This doesnt seem right to me so i was wondering anyone else has been told this or if i should get a second opinion

s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,High Blood Pressure medication My doctors dall think that i most likely have POTS
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,but i have yet to hear back about my tilt table test and my follow up appointment is in february
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,my primary care doctor prescribed me metropropilol
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,which is a high blood pressure medication
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,he prescribed it to me for my tachycardia
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,but whenever i took it i would pass out
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,so i stopped taking it and havent seen this doctor since
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,i tried to do a bit more research
s7c3o3,t5_2saq9,and i learned that my bp is actually on the lower end

ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,Levetiracetam Keppra Questions My husband of  years is the one with epilepsy
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,And he just switched neurologists to have one closer to home
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,He is a yo who has tonic clonic aka grand mal seizures often triggered by sleep deprivation
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,and unluckily sexual activity
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,Im the closest person to him and often the only one who gets to see the episodes
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,go to doctors appointments
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,He started taking Keppra about a year and a half ago
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,I dont remember why he switched medication but the neurologist he did have had him on only one mg tablet a day
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,He was still having seizures while on this medication
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,We get a new neurologist and he cant for the life of him figure out why the previous one had him on only one tablet a day when apparently we didnt know the pill is only designed to last for  hours
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,That left him completely unprotected for half a day
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,I was angry
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,This new doctor was angry
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,So new tip to myself and anyone it may help out RESEARCH YOUR MEDS and your spouses

ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,my husband has gotten this itchy
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,burning rash all over his hands
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,And the change of the dose in medication is the only new factor
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,Anyone else had this happen
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,What do we do
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,What other side effects of this medication should we look out for
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,I mean hes been taking it
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,just not twice a day
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,after I thoroughly considered everything else detergent
ru3d29,t5_2s1h9,etc he has this rash

rjm1zz,t5_2s1h9,My -year-old daughter has absence epilepsy and between the epilepsy and the medicine shes having trouble learning to read
rjm1zz,t5_2s1h9,Our school recommended that we get a neuropsychiatric evaluation to find out what if any learning disabilities she has so that we can respond appropriately

rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Brand new here with bad deja vu seeking treatment Hey so doing my research on my freaky experiences and here I am
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Ive had strange deja vu experiences I think since I was a child
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,But about  years ago I had a really bad one
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,It was sort of like everyday objects
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,basically everything in my visual field started to get this dream like familiarity I call them associations
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,This will grow into a memory of a dream or something and then just a full blown deja vu dream like state for - sec
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,It is very unpleasant and nightmarish usually
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,It left me in a cold sweat and pale face
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Had a few smaller ones a bit later
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Wife to me to the ER and they loosely diagnosed partial aware seizure
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,I left and ignored it since I felt completely better dumb
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,The last episode before that was maybe  or  years prior
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Here I am  years later
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Had a week of really bad sleep
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Last Thursday had a bad one had to sit down
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,vision went black same deal deja vu waking dream
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,But had another later
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,More the next day
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,then even  or  during the night
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Went to the ER again on day   CT scan and MRI and EEG
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,They gave me Ativan intravenously with the MRI and I was instantly cured
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,But then they put me on  hr EEG overnight and had only  very faint ones I think because the Ativan knocked it out
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Neurologist checks and no seizures on EEG
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Doc wants me medicated for panic attacks
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,SSRI  Im a bit torn because I dont feel depressed normally except after a bad one it leaves me very emotional and scared like sobbing in my wives arms at one point
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Everything Ive read about Auras sounds EXACTLY like what I experienced
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,I feel better now but have an appt with a neurologist next week but it may be  years till the next episode
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Any advice or questions to ask or tests to have done
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Could it really just be panic attacks
rcyasp,t5_2s1h9,Would I need to be medicated if they only come every  years or so

pejf65,t5_2r876,Just concerned
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9, hour inpatient EEG I understand that none of you are doctors
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,but  please give me your best advice
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,based on your experience with epilepsy so far
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I am asking because unfortunately
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I am trying to save as much money as possible and if this isnt likely to get me any answers
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I want to hold off and do a test that will likely show me more answers
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,My neurologist scheduled me for a  hour inpatient video EEG
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I think she only did this because I have been complaining of emotionalmental side effects
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I hadnt had any more auraspartials in the month before she ordered it
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,It was a direct response to me complaining of mental side effects of my meds
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,She is a neurologist
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,and not an Epilepsy specialist
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,if that matters
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I have had  TC seizure
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,in July 
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,Ive been on Oxcarbazapine x daily
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I do get occasional partials
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,They do not happen with any regularity
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,and no triggers that I can pin down
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I guess my question is
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,How likely is this that it wont show anything since I only have these partials - days a month and never at the same time
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I guess Im worried Ill be paying for an inpatient stay with no findings
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,In your guys opinion
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,would a  hour inpatient eeg be worth doing still
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,I did have a partial this morning
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,they happen with ZERO predictability
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,and maybe - days a month
rwp7yr,t5_2s1h9,This test wouldnt happen until next month and I may not have any at that time
s7biye,t5_2s23e,How often are your MRIs scheduled
s7biye,t5_2s23e,Just checking in because Im curious how often does everyone get their MRI post-diagnosis
s7biye,t5_2s23e,Ive had an MRI scheduled with and without contrast each year since diagnosis ten years ago
s7biye,t5_2s23e,Its fun to compare the scans and maybe one day Ill make a gif from year to year
s7biye,t5_2s23e,Gettin real used to trying to convince myself Im just jamming to dubstep in a sleeper pod in outer space once a year
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,years ago I started hearing voices of the characters from a novel I was writing
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,Over the course of all these years Ive learned absolutely everything about them that they told me I subconsciously created and that was nothing like how I wrote my book
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,not even close
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,They told me I was there god
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,there creator as youd call it
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,Ive gotten so many tattoos of them and there life
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,even what they look like
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,I see them in my minds eye
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,I speak to them through my mind as well
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,I believe that they are actually real and in a different dimension I am my own god
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,I created them and the dimension through the thought power of manifestation
s91tug,t5_2tyg2,Has anyone else experienced something similar
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Is buzzing in ears a part of psychosis
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,I also did get punched in the ear years ago by an abusive boyfriend until some blood came out
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Not sure whats from what
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Kind of want to post another question relating work too
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Random but same boyfriend seen me on psychosis Reddit in the summer of  when I felt I did have a psychotic break Im pretty sure
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,We met with a couples therapist where I said I couldnt tell what was real or fake
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,I wanted hospitalization then not now
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Now I have this a bit more under controlled
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Not as well but still manageable
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,The guy literally hit me and said Ill tell everyone you dont know what youre talking about and that you have schizophrenia
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,same guy now still fucks with me
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Havent really talked to him for two days
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,First day called to make sure he wasnt dead as he said hed K himself for weeks I was anxious and caved
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Ended in a fight even though I said I was having S word thoughts at my new first job last week
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,moral of the rant is I just was trying to get ANY freaking help in  and then I came to Reddit
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,You know not really the spot I wanted to be and he told me to get off of here
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Its clear he doesnt have my best interest
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,I get it but hes quite literally insane because he tries to convince my mom and family that something is wrong with me when in reality nothing is wrong he just fucks with me sincerely so hard and I have NO ONE to talk to
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,Sometimes I want to K myself but since I am aware and have some people who have actually been there for me that I trust is the only reason right now I wont
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,I think a lot about them often until I feel good
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,I gave up smoking but I smoked today after I had went to therapy because it was just freaking hard
s3bcc2,t5_2tyg2,This is all harder than I expected
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,hey everyone Ive never set up anything here but Im  and have had CF my whole life
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,I have had Kaftrio for half a year now and my lung function has gone from  to almost 
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,before this I had a lot of lung bleeding I had  embolisms
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,unfortunately that did nothing and I kept on the tranexcamine
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,since the start of kaftrio I have had zero lung bleeding so I stopped the tranex after  months of kaftrio because I didnt dare to stop mentally
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,but last night it started again
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,little bit fresh about a tablespoon
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,I was just a little less anxious mentally
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,I had started kickboxing and was picking up fitness again like before the bleeding was so frequent
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,Now Im already scared to go through with everything like before
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,I always feel like Im going to die when it starts or it never ends
q9vw8r,t5_2r876,maybe someone here can reassure me   Ive never had contact with other cfers
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,I went hyper the past  months since my last labs and I realized my stomach issues got worse at the peak of my hyper episode for those who dont know
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,you are very lucky to not experience hyperthyroidism
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,I started PPIs a month after my my hypo  lab appointment
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Possibility of turning hyper at this time I did lose a lot of weight
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,and continued to do so
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,which could have contributed to my overactive thyroid
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Went off PPIs probably
roypjf,t5_2qlaa, weeks prior to today I also did not follow the full course of  weeks Prilosec side effects sucked too much
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,and then randomly the week of this very intense hyper episode my symptoms came roaring back into what Ive never experienced before I was originally diagnosed with LPR  Gastritis  Heartburn  Abdominal pain  Regurgitation   Acid in mouth   And additional LPR symptoms that have faded acid in eyessinusesears yep sucks  Anyone with thyroid issues experience autoimmune gastritis  GERD or is this too niche
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,I looked up the relationship with your thyroid
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,specifically when it is hyper and there seems to be a connection here with stomach issues
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Curious if this was the case
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Went in and explained to GI and it sounds like typical acid reflux to him note he is not a thyroid expert
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,so did not have insight into this particular phenomenonit seems to all be treated primarily the same in the GERD department
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Edit hi just came back here to say that
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,my GERD was  Hypothyroid  Hashimotos connected
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Been eating the worst trigger foods the past week and nothing adjusted my Letho dose  weeks ago
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Crazy that your thyroid can make such an impact across the entire body
roypjf,t5_2qlaa,Get it checked
rzug9h,t5_2s1h9,Anyone experienced something similiar
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,How had meditation helped for yall
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,I have MS on the right side of my brainoccipital lobe right now
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,I believe I have occipital  trigeminal nueralgia right now
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,Havent been able to confirm it with my nuero until next Monday
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,I believe it blocks the flow of my neurons from the back of my brain to my face all around to my neck and down to the right side of my body
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,Its super painful and feels like a total blockage of neurons
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,What has help you guys as far as meditation goes
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,I just add sometimes I get discouraged that these blockages arent been healed through mediation
s9fhkc,t5_2s23e,This doesnt mean I shouldnt stop meditating of course
qwyp5t,t5_2syer,Higher vitamin C intake is independently associated with a lower risk of gout
qwyp5t,t5_2syer,Supplemental vitamin C intake may be beneficial in the prevention of gout
sssmsn,t5_2s3g1,Is there such a thing as a painless colon cleanse
sssmsn,t5_2s3g1,So I need to completely clean myself out for a lack of better term
sssmsn,t5_2s3g1,But I always experience cramping that I am trying to avoid
sssmsn,t5_2s3g1,Is there a way to do this without the cramping
sssmsn,t5_2s3g1,Or anything to completely make the cramping go away
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,How do I not spiral
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,Im okay most days
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,but when I start to talk about med changes
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,anything related to epilepsy I start to get into a spiraling thought process of poor me
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,I know there are others in the world that have it worse than us
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,but that doesnt invalidate the difficult and incredibly frustrating experiences epilepsy puts us through
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,Ive started to continue the spiral of why my life sucks because of epilepsy and its really hard not to do it every day
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,Which I have been
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,A lot of crying
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,My support system is amazing
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,I have a lot of things in life that make me happy
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,but somehow epilepsy continues to feel like it reigns over all that and ruin an aspect of everything
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,What if I have one in front of a friend who hasnt seen me have one before
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,At my new job
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,At the movies
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,I hate having my loved ones worry if Im going to have one
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,I hate when my mom cries because she knows how frustrated I am when I have one
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,How do I stop the spiral of epilepsy depression
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,I dont have diagnosed depression
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,I confidently say that
rw4zb0,t5_2s1h9,but just get really upset when thinking about everything in life epilepsy touches
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,On those rare days where my stomach doesnt bother me
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,I begin to question my entire existence I dont have good days and the occasional flare-up
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,I dont have frequent flare-ups
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,IBSD is just my constant state of being
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,Most of the time
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,instead of good days the best I can hope for is good moments
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,And even then
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,it could be hard to enjoy it because Im in constant fear of the next problem
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,But then there is the exceptionally rare day where I have absolutely no issues
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,To the point where its not even on my mind
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,It makes me question everything
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,When I see what my life could be without IBS
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,it makes me wonder what kind of person I would be
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,What I actually be happy
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,Am I capable of happiness
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,Could I develop hobbies and passions and get a real career instead of working crap jobs just because they give me a stress-free environment and a flexible schedule
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,Im not looking for advice
sn83c6,t5_2s3g1,Im just ranting
s7joak,t5_2rtve,Has anyone experienced bone pain
s7joak,t5_2rtve,I met with my new pain management doctor recently
s7joak,t5_2rtve,She read all of my files from my rheumatologist
s7joak,t5_2rtve,pretty much everyone
s7joak,t5_2rtve,We talked about the kind of pain I have
s7joak,t5_2rtve,how bad it gets
s7joak,t5_2rtve,etc and she said that it sounded to her like bone pain
s7joak,t5_2rtve,I was just wondering if anyone thats been diagnosed with lupus I was diagnosed with SLE has found that its affected their bones and has bone pain
s7joak,t5_2rtve,I havent had a chance to talk to my rheumatologist about it I moved to a new state
s7joak,t5_2rtve,so my first appointment with my new rheum isnt for a couple of weeks yet
s7joak,t5_2rtve,but definitely will
s7joak,t5_2rtve,I was just wondering if bone pain can be caused by lupus
s7joak,t5_2rtve,I do have severe joint pain and osteoporosis from too much prednisone
s7joak,t5_2rtve,but I never considered that it could be part of the reason for my pain
s7joak,t5_2rtve,is there a way to check and see if thats the problem
s7joak,t5_2rtve,Ive done bone density tests
s7joak,t5_2rtve,but all they tell me is that I have osteoporosis and not much else
s7joak,t5_2rtve,Thanks very much

s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,Whos used MS Workouts
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,Interested in hearing your experience
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,I saw someone recommend or mention this awhile back
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,Asked my MS Physical Therapist to check it out
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,and she felt like it was done by people who are knowledgeable and gave me the thumbs up
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,I graduated from PT but have struggled to keep up with exercises and I feel the loss
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,So heres my question if youve used it
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,The  day free trial is super sales-y to me
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,which turns me off
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,If you did the subscription
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,does that sales-y piece go away
s3t7qo,t5_2s23e,Im literally fast forwarding my way through the free videos at this point
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Gout from an injury to toe So about two months ago my metatarsal toe joint on my left foot started to feel achey and sore
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Thinking I just overdid the joint after months of daily walks with the dog in nothing but sandals
shqhlo,t5_2syer,I thought it would come right after a little while
shqhlo,t5_2syer,How wrong was I
shqhlo,t5_2syer,When the NZ lockdown finally lifted and gyms opened back up
shqhlo,t5_2syer,I kinda went ham and did a whole lot of weighted exercises at the gym
shqhlo,t5_2syer,which may well have aggravated the already-grumpy toe joint
shqhlo,t5_2syer,In the next couple of days
shqhlo,t5_2syer,the joint became very sore
shqhlo,t5_2syer,stiff and red
shqhlo,t5_2syer,It got so bad that I had to get crutches to walk around
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Hyperextending it was unthinkable as the joint was stiffer than Stiffy and the pain was sharper than a no to a marriage proposal
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Over the next month
shqhlo,t5_2syer,I saw the physio weekly and for the first three sessions we thought that it was just a case of a very slowly-healing sprain
shqhlo,t5_2syer,However by the fourth visit it had flared up again after a period of about two weeks where it had gradually settled down
shqhlo,t5_2syer,and I assumed that I was on my way to recovery
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Funnily enough the night before I was a fat shit and had basically five servings of beef which back then I didnt quite realise was rich in purine
shqhlo,t5_2syer,the joint was very sore
shqhlo,t5_2syer,redpurple and hot to touch
shqhlo,t5_2syer,she referred me to the doctors who then had me X-rayed
shqhlo,t5_2syer,blood-tested and ultimately ultrasound
shqhlo,t5_2syer,The X-ray result turned up nothing
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Blood test results were normal i
shqhlo,t5_2syer,within normal levels of non-goutness
shqhlo,t5_2syer,However ultrasound saw that the joint was very inflamed
shqhlo,t5_2syer,and the lady thought that may toe injury had triggered gout which apparently is very common
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Armed with this knowledge
shqhlo,t5_2syer,a second doctor prescribed me  days of prednisone of mg per day
shqhlo,t5_2syer,over two pills daily
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Hes given me some extra as backup just in case
shqhlo,t5_2syer,and I am now on my th day and plan to stop it from tomorrow as I know I shouldnt be on it for any extended period of time
shqhlo,t5_2syer,While the the pain and stiffness has largely say  dissipated the external symptoms redness
shqhlo,t5_2syer,slight swelling remain especially at night time or after the gym which I have heavily modified to go easy on the feet
shqhlo,t5_2syer,My concern is that once I stop the prednisone
shqhlo,t5_2syer,that this gout
shqhlo,t5_2syer, will just rebound
shqhlo,t5_2syer,with a vengeance
shqhlo,t5_2syer,In the past week Ive also modified my diet to consume less purine-rich foods
shqhlo,t5_2syer,and have also taken some supplements formulated to help with uric acid levels concentrated cherry extracts
shqhlo,t5_2syer,celery seeds etc
shqhlo,t5_2syer,While I will be in touch with my doctor again tomorrow to try and figure out the next steps of this dilemma I turn to you fellow gout-havers especially those whose flare ups were precipitated by an injury
shqhlo,t5_2syer,What was your experience
shqhlo,t5_2syer,what did you do to get better
shqhlo,t5_2syer,and what advice can you impart
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Right now I just want my life back while Im not in pain while Ive been on prednisone
shqhlo,t5_2syer,Im still weary that this will come back once I stop taking it
shqhlo,t5_2syer,I would like to enjoy the simple pleasures of life taking the dog for his daily walks
shqhlo,t5_2syer,getting back to a normal gym routine
shqhlo,t5_2syer,getting out and enjoying the outdoors all of which have been put on pause as Im fearful of injuring this joint even further and triggering another gout flare up
shqhlo,t5_2syer,I really appreciate everyone who stuck around to read this long-ass post
shqhlo,t5_2syer,but Im at my wits end and would love some reassurance and sage advice
shqhlo,t5_2syer,May prosperity abound for us gout people
shqhlo,t5_2syer,what do I do

q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Nasal AtroventAny experiences
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Tldr any experiences with side effects from nasal atrovent
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,I had sinus surgery in 
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,been on Trikafta trial since around the same time
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Things went well until earlier this year when I started having sinus pain again
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,as well as more or less constant post nasal drip which may be the cause of  months of AM shortness of breath
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,I finally went to the CF ENT yesterday and the scope of my lower sinuses looked good but he prescribed me nasal atrovent to
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,calm down the over sensitive mucus production in my nose
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Its not a short term -day burst like most people seem to get from my limited googling
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,it would be a permanent addition to my sinus routine
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Took it last night and it worked SO fast but it also gave me a killer sinus headache and some very rapid onset nausea that took literally five hours to go away
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Today the sinus pressure was so significant that when I started to cry about a stupid work thing I had to stop because it hurt so bad
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,I had an easier time breathing today than I have in probably  months
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Tonight I pre dosed with ibuprofen
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,so no headache but I also took mg of Zofran and am still nauseous
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Im going to call my doctor
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,but if anyone else has experience with this med especially if you had similar side effects that got better Id like to know because I really do want to stay on it and can stick it out for a couple weeks if I have to
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,But I cant realistically pre dose with Zofran and ibuprofen forever just to take a single nasal spray
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Also if anyone has had the RhinAer procedure done
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,interested in experiences
q3rq5i,t5_2r876,Thats option B and it sounds supremely unfun
s7xf93,t5_2tyg2,Why do I feel like I am faking psychosis
s7xf93,t5_2tyg2,I cant help to think that Im faking it and fooling all the professionals that have diagnosed me with a psychotic disorder and prescribed me antipsychotics
s7xf93,t5_2tyg2,I cant identify with it when they try and explain how unwell I was at certain points and what I was like
s7xf93,t5_2tyg2,I feel like Im just fooling everybody and I was never psychotic
s7xf93,t5_2tyg2,Does anyone else feel like a fake sometimes
s7xf93,t5_2tyg2,Like Im just doing this for attention or something
s7xf93,t5_2tyg2,I know I dont even want the attention but I cant help but to think that Im just faking this

si3j24,t5_2s23e,Dimming eyesight at times Just wondering if its common with MS to feel like everything is very dim
si3j24,t5_2s23e,and like even if you turn all the lights on its not bright enough
si3j24,t5_2s23e,I can see but everything looks desaturated
si3j24,t5_2s23e,I assumed this was dissociation but its been happening more frequently without any other side affects
si3j24,t5_2s23e,I do freak out a bit when it happens so I thought it was just a mental thing but now wondering if anyone with MS has had this experience
s68ea0,t5_2saq9,Im currently on propranolol mg x a day for the last week
s68ea0,t5_2saq9,yesterday I had a horrible bradycardic  episode where I was dizzy
s68ea0,t5_2saq9,palps and HR was at bpm
s68ea0,t5_2saq9,A doctor has suggested I start bisoprolol instead from tomorrow at 
s68ea0,t5_2saq9,Has anyone tried this
s68ea0,t5_2saq9,An additional reason why i started on propranolol was because I have migraines and anxiety so I wondered if anyone had found it useful for that
spdc2e,t5_2saq9,Symptoms after Decreasing Midodrine Have any of you been on midodrine and had to lower your dose after a while
spdc2e,t5_2saq9,Ive been on midodrine for - years and have consistently taken it 
spdc2e,t5_2saq9,mg  times a day
spdc2e,t5_2saq9,My blood pressure is starting to regulate itself and its been higher

smufl5,t5_2s3g1,Simply focusing on relaxing and breathing into your stomach really helps
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,I saw an acupuncturist recently who said I needed to start breathing into my stomach
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,Sounded good so I tried
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,It was really uncomfortable and made me realize how tense my stomach was
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,For the last month Ive been working on breathing into my stomach and letting things relax
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,Its gotten way less uncomfortable and my digestion has gotten a lot better
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,I also listened to an IBS meditation app for a while that also helped me get in the right head space around this
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,Just pay attention to how your stomach feels
smufl5,t5_2s3g1,especially when you breath into it

ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,Natural remedies Once the whole Covid outbreak started
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,I began to do a lot of research on what I could take in case I got it
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,So I kept up with studies done by the NIH and other countries on how to fight it
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,and several others
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,But that got me curious to what other things have been studies regarding epilepsy
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,And theres quite a bit
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,Double blind studies have shown many over the counter supplements can help
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,Some in the list include a large amount of vitamins D
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,A Google search on each one of these will pull up links to the studies
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,Just search for NIH
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,and the above medication
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,and most of them show up to half of the people in the control groups saw improvement
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,and placebo no change
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,I think one of the studies was on dogs
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,So if youre sick of epilepsy
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,then maybe throw everything you can at it
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,especially if it doesnt have to be prescribed
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,Although I read in the UK
ro31hp,t5_2s1h9,some supplements must be prescribed

rirms0,t5_2s1h9,My faith in the medical system is gone
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,ive had so many bad neurologists since I was diagnosed at 
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,Ive had doctors tell me it was my fault I had epilepsy because I was a woman with a menstrual cycle and if I would Just stop bleeding then I wouldnt have seizures anymore
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,Ive been told my seizures were caused by a magnetic imbalance in the solar system
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,Ive also been accused of faking because all my EEGs came back clean until I finally got a seizure on video to show them
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,Finally I was about to age out of pediatrics but I had one last doctors appointment in December of 
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,the neurologist was urging for  a MRI scan to be done in February
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,and then scheduled it for the same day I had planned to have a friend come into town from out of state
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,the doctor swore it was just a Routine MRI and nothing unusual so I asked if it could be pushed a week
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,he insisted no
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,I put it off myself
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,as I was dumb but also had been fully reassured that despite my doctors urgency they werent looking for anything specific
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,it was just a routine MRI
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,I got the MRI done later and in August of  I got a call from that same neurologist who admitted they were infact looking for something and I had a brain stem glioma
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,But that I should be grateful because it hasnt affected my epilepsy
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,when I asked him why they didnt tell me thats what they were looking for he said they already knew it was there because scans from Five Years Ago showed it but they needed a better angle to confirm before it was mentioned to me
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,I asked why the better angle wasnt done years ago
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,and he said he wasnt sure why the other doctors hadnt done it
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,I asked why he hadnt since he has been my doctor for two of those years and hes also supposed to go over old scans
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,he also had no answer
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,Since then my anxiety has gotten worse and ive now developed severe depression
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,I havent seen another neurologist since because I keep asking my PCP to write referrals and when he does
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,his office staff sends me to places that are either full or dont accept my insurance
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,And does the same thing for all the other referrals im waiting on for unrelated specialists I love this doctor
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,hes easily the best PCP ive had in a long time but his receptionists suck
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,TLDR Ive had a long history of shitty doctors
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,and im now struggling to get in with a new neurologist
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,I worry when I find one that ill be another name on a waitlist forever despite the looming anxiety of my newly diagnosed brain tumor  epilepsy
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,Im swamped in stress and feel at my ropes end
rirms0,t5_2s1h9,im extremely overwhelmed in medical issues and im not even  yet

sj6m31,t5_2syer,He basically needs this to function
sj6m31,t5_2syer,otherwise the gout will be so bad he is bedridden in extreme pain
sj6m31,t5_2syer,He went to the doctor recently and the they are trying to wean him off of this unknown medication
sj6m31,t5_2syer,A lab to get it identified costs about k so thats not money he wants to spend
sj6m31,t5_2syer,His doctor thinks its a steroid but no one really knows
sj6m31,t5_2syer,The part that is a real mystery for me is that he has had a very strict diet for the past three months and hasnt really lost any weight
sj6m31,t5_2syer,no carbs or sugars except some fruit
sj6m31,t5_2syer,My suspicion is this mystery medicine is preventing the weight loss
sj6m31,t5_2syer,He does have diabetes but his sugar is under control just from the diet so he isnt taking diabetes meds
sj6m31,t5_2syer,my first thought was the diabetes meds could be the cause of the weight not being shed but since hes not taking the diabetes meds it might be the unknown medicine from Mexico thats preventing the weight loss
sj6m31,t5_2syer,He does also take meds for high blood pressure
sj6m31,t5_2syer,He also suffers kidney stones and pain
sj6m31,t5_2syer,I am thinking as a side effect of the other medicine
sj6m31,t5_2syer,Also his liver is in bad shape but it did improve recently evidenced by his lab tests
sj6m31,t5_2syer,He has fatty liver
sj6m31,t5_2syer,Does anyone know what kind of medicine it could be
sj6m31,t5_2syer,Its unmarked pills
sj6m31,t5_2syer,Has anyone here ever used a medicine that gives relief as fast as this
sj6m31,t5_2syer,If anyone here is thinking to take it please dont
sj6m31,t5_2syer,It doesnt solve the problem
sj6m31,t5_2syer,It just kicks the can down the road
sj6m31,t5_2syer,Im not sure how to fix the issue
sj6m31,t5_2syer,If he stops cold turkey he will be out for a few weeks at least in extreme pain
sj6m31,t5_2syer,Edit Here is a pic of the pill
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,I have a doctors appt Monday and will take medical advice from my doctor
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,I am looking for support or similar experiences
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Ive never experienced acid reflux or stomach issues before this except for a few stomach bugs over the years
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,At Thanksgiving I had really bad reflux
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,but to be fair I was eating terribly and drinking a lot
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,I usually do a lot of exercise and cardio
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,but the last  months have been hard
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Inbetween a broken tail bone
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,then  months later a broken fibula
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Ive gained a few pounds and really struggled with being able to exercise
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Then a few days before Xmas I had terrible acid reflux
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,My esophagus felt tight
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,vague pains in my neck
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,much worse when I laid down
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,My husband is a psychiatrist
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,doctor but not up to date on stomach stuff and suggested maybe it was gerd
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,and I should make an appt with my doctor
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,I found this group and Ive stuck to a mostly gerd diet the past week
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Yesterday I slipped up with a bloody Mary
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,But I was surprised that I didnt get any reflux
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Gas pains last night
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Deeper in my belly below the diaphragm
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,and diarrhea today
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,So maybe its not gerd
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Maybe its pylori
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Or some kind of long lasting bug
rs4bcq,t5_2qlaa,Has anyone else experienced this
rfqm6u,t5_2rtve,post diagnosis Ive been struggling mentally since being diagnosed
rfqm6u,t5_2rtve,Every ache and sleepy day give me so much anxiety that a flare might be coming

rfwfhe,t5_2syer,So I had my first gout flair up about two weeks ago
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,I went to the Dr
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,he gave me  days of steroids and told me
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,to take black cherry extract capsules
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,I fi ished the meds and I still have it
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,I also got a sinus infection about  days ago and I just finished meds for that
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,Tomorrow will be day  or  and its still terrible
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,Just some background info
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,I started a low carb diet back in June
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,Ive lost over  pounds in half a year
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,No idea if thats significant or not just want to give all the details of whats happening
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,I only drink flavored water and diet Lipton green tea
rfwfhe,t5_2syer,Is there anything I can try that doesnt require a needle
seh0z9,t5_2tyg2,How do you feel when you have a psychotic break
sfjdnb,t5_2tyg2,Feeling like a shell of a person since psychosis Its been almost  months since I experienced psychosis ever since then it feels like the old me died and now Im just a shell of a person
sfjdnb,t5_2tyg2,I also have to take Risperidone which makes everything just harder
sfjdnb,t5_2tyg2,I absolutely hate my life after psychosis not being able to do drugs
sfjdnb,t5_2tyg2,to feel joy or happiness
sfjdnb,t5_2tyg2,to socialize fucking sucks
sfjdnb,t5_2tyg2,I wish it just never happened

sduekd,t5_2rtve,what should I look out for and be aware of
sduekd,t5_2rtve,New diagnosis for her
sduekd,t5_2rtve,Im clueless on this
q40w3u,t5_2syer,Seeing the Rheumatologist Next Week Ive had gout for several years now and always tried to keep flares at bay with diet
q40w3u,t5_2syer,but after reading about the potential long term effects to joints if not properly treated through medication
q40w3u,t5_2syer,Im biting the bullet and getting on Allo
q40w3u,t5_2syer,I saw my family doctor and he prescribed me mg without doing any bloodwork
q40w3u,t5_2syer,but I wanted to see a rheumatologist about it first before I started taking any medication
q40w3u,t5_2syer,After months of waiting
q40w3u,t5_2syer,my appointment is next week
q40w3u,t5_2syer,I got blood work done today so still waiting for results
q40w3u,t5_2syer,but to maximize my appointment
q40w3u,t5_2syer,since the wait list for these kind of things is forever
q40w3u,t5_2syer,what are some questions I should be asking the specialist
q40w3u,t5_2syer,I dont want it to just be you have gout
q40w3u,t5_2syer,take this pill and shepherd me out
q40w3u,t5_2syer,so what were some things people asked about that you found important to
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,GERD made me lose  pounds in  days
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,This is what happened
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,this is going to be a long wall of text
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,so bare with me
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Also take into account english is not my first language
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,so I apologize for spelling mistakes in advanced
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Last sunday I had a horrible gerd flare
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,woke up feeling crap
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,back wash in mouth
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,you name it
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Things got progressively worse by dinner
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,by that time I had already lost my appetite so
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,in my twisted wisdom to avoid the pain
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,decided that keeping meal servings as small as possible during the next week would actually benefit me
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,This turned to be a big mistake
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,ate a half a banana for breakfast
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,a small bowl of chiken soup for supper
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,two cookies for dinner
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I also drank like  liters of water that day
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,since it helps dillute the acid on my stomach
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Do take into a account I stay rather active
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,my exercise routine consists of a mix of yoga
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,skipping rope and HIIT
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,for atleast  to  min each day
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I fell rather good that day and slept with little annoyance
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Along came tuesday
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and had a small serving of natural yogurth no added sugar for breakfast
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,half a sandwich for supper
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and again  just cookies for dinner
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I went to bed feeling rather normal
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Then all hell broke loose
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I literally start having nightmares non stop
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,just to be awaken after around  hours of sleep
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,by a massive panic attack
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,hands and feet sweating
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,heart beating like crazy
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,brutal hot and cold flashes
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I literally thinking Im about to freaking die
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I go to the mirror and splash water to my face and try to calm down
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Then I feel the belching and burning coming up
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I quickly down several antiacids like a maniac and the burning sensation on my face slowly fades away
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,but the shivering and tremors kept going
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,so I pace myself around the house trying to calm myself down
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I put some relaxing audios
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,get on the bed
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,do some breathing exercises
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and after  hours my panic subsides
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,yet my heart rate is still elevated and just cant manage to sleep
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,so I stayed up for the rest of the night
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,So finally the sun rises and decide to breakfast with several fruit
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,jam and every sugary thing I can get my hands on
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Finally the sweaty hands
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,tachycardia and tremors subside
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Im calmed but absolutely exhausted
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I fix myself and head to my GP to explain the whole ordeal
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,but just before leaving the house I weight myself
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and to my surprise I had lost  pounds
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,which is of course is incredibly substantial for such small timeframe
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Then it hit me
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I reckognize what had just happened during the night
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,hypoglicemia and hypovolemia
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,being a biomed major myself and taken several physiology courses I understand the mechanism of how this came to be
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,The low blood sugar can be explained by the sudden caloric deficit when I drastically restricted my food intaked
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,blinded by the gerd pains
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and the depletion of glucogen deposits in my muscles
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,due to not reducing my normal exercise habits
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,which on retrospective consideration I should have
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,The hypovolemia or sudden fall of blood pressure can be explained by me drinking  liters of water those two days
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,but with an incredibly reduced intake of sugar and salt
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,which of course let to dillution and  diuresis
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I literally urinated a lot of water from my body
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,which of course wasnt properly replaced with oral rehydration
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,that being proper ions  glucose solution
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,went with my gp and finally got my meds changed
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,suspecting esophagitis and possible ulcer
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I had my PPIs replaced for those of a newer generation
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and placed on sucralfate and pramigel for a month
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Needless to say
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,my gerd symptoms have reduced substanstialy
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,That night I sleep through out the whole night
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Waking up a little crampy and sweaty
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,but feeling normal
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,So thursday I had a regular breakfast and supper
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and start feeling my heart pounding
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,but my resting heart frequency was normal
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,this eventually subsided after dinner
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,By that time I weighted myself again
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I had regained  pounds
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,The heart pounding you ask
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,My body adjusting to the now regained fluid volume
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Today Im feeling fine
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,but of course the whole ordeal was rather scary
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,If I hadnt suffered from panic attacks  on the past
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,I would have probably lost complete control of my mind
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Luckily I know when to recognize them and how to de-escalate
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Let this be a Public Service Announcement of how NOT to severely restrict your diet in a sudden attempt to reduce your gerd symptoms
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,But if your gonna do it
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,at least get some good oral hydration so you dont lose as much fluids as I did in such a small timeframe
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,Its better to reduce food intake gradually
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,no matter how much your discomfort might be
rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,and to treat the symptoms with your medication in a controlled fashion
s2o072,t5_2saq9,Someone has probably already posted this here
s2o072,t5_2saq9,but I know we all can relate
syf2ly,t5_2saq9,Hyper pots and adrenaline dumps Those of you with hyper pots
syf2ly,t5_2saq9,can you tell me how often you have adrenaline dumps

syf2ly,t5_2saq9,Its insane how hard it is to find information on this topic online
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,Should I be concerned after taking approx
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,lbs I have struggled greatly with IBS-C since college
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,My constipation got so bad I was in the hospital at least once or twice a year for severe impactions
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,Greatly after changing my diet
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,my IBS-C went in remission except for the occasional  to  capfuls of Miralax and  or  senna gummies to get things moving again
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,Well this week I was under more stress than I could have imagined due to school and family
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,and ended up getting backed up
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,Heres what I did Tuesday constipated day  took  capfuls of miralax plus  senna gummies kid dose
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,Wednesday Bowel movement   Thursday Normal bowel movement then mots of constipation symptoms
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,Friday constipated took  capfuls of miralax and  senna gummies had a BM  Saturday BM but felt extremely backed up at night took  capfuls miralax  Sundaytoday took  capfuls Miralax had a BM
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,I am worried if I am taking too much Miralax
sxdcql,t5_2s3g1,Is Miralax safe
sszatl,t5_2s3g1,Sucrase deficiency how long for symptoms to improve
sszatl,t5_2s3g1,I was wondering people who have been diagnosed with a sucrose intolerance sucrase deficiency how long it took on a sucrose free diet before symptoms improved
sszatl,t5_2s3g1,Does anyone know if there have been any studies on this
sszatl,t5_2s3g1,Most dietary guidelines appear to recommend a four week elimination period
sszatl,t5_2s3g1,but I dont know why that timeframe is chosen when most of the research seems to suggest the issues caused by the sucrose are due to its osmotic effects in the colon
sszatl,t5_2s3g1,and so on this basis one would anticipate things would improve once the undigested sucrose was excreted
pxgie2,t5_2r876,Canada Provincial Trikafta Coverage Hi everyone
pxgie2,t5_2r876,With the Ontario
pxgie2,t5_2r876,and Quebec announcements
pxgie2,t5_2r876,Im as confused as ever regarding provincial coverage
pxgie2,t5_2r876,Since the announcements came so quickly
pxgie2,t5_2r876,my clinic seems confused as well
pxgie2,t5_2r876,and from what I understand
pxgie2,t5_2r876,it will be covered through ODB
pxgie2,t5_2r876,with EAP only needed if you dont meet the lung function criteria of  
pxgie2,t5_2r876,I have heard conflicting things
pxgie2,t5_2r876,Has anyone talked to their clinic or Vertex patient liaison about obtaining Trikafta through provincial coverage
pxgie2,t5_2r876,Thanks so much in advance
pxgie2,t5_2r876,ETA I received a Quality of Life questionnaire from my clinic this morning for the EAP application
pxgie2,t5_2r876,So it does look like
pxgie2,t5_2r876,regardless of lung function
pxgie2,t5_2r876,there are extra hoops to jump through for access

ovfq1i,t5_2syer,Anyone else have Guillain-Barré
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,I finally started allopurinol at the end of June
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,All went well for about  days and I started experiencing lower leg weakness
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,It progressed over the next couple of days until I ended up in ER because I had trouble walking
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,I was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome and started on IVIG immediately
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,After a  day hospital stay including rehab I was luckily able to walk out of the hospital
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,I am in no way indicating that this was brought on by starting allo as I truly believe the timing was coincidental
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,So here I ampcp and Neuro both saying ok to restart Allo but my head is obviously reeling
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,I did have them run an SUA the day before I left and it was 
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,Ive not yet had any flares but thinking possibly because of IVIG
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,I found two very small studies
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,one indicating a difference in pts with GBS and SUA levels being much lower than controls
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,The other one I found showed higher CSF levels of UA
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,One or two case studies show allo association with myositis obviously not what I had
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,Anyone else with gout have GBS and willing to share
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,Edit I do not think this was caused by Covid vaccine as I completed the Pfizer series in January
ovfq1i,t5_2syer,I had a summer cold that cleared about  weeks preceding onset
qyatjr,t5_2rtve,Im new to the injections and my first one is Monday Ive been looking over what I should prep and I was reading on injection site spot it says to stay away from scar tissue but  the best spot is the stomach
qyatjr,t5_2rtve,I have tons of scar tissue and stretch marks on my stomach like alot from being pregnant they are very visible and are built up alot
qyatjr,t5_2rtve,I know the arm and thigh is ok too but jw what other people or ladies with stretch marks did when the best spot isnt actually the best

rzrzgo,t5_2s23e,I am really confused as to what is causing it
rzrzgo,t5_2s23e,as this is really new to me
rzrzgo,t5_2s23e,It somehow goes away once my body has cooled down
rzrzgo,t5_2s23e,Im not sure if this is just anxiety or actually a symptom of MS
rzrzgo,t5_2s23e,so Im curious as to how your numbness symptoms look like
rzrzgo,t5_2s23e,edit I havent been diagnosed yet
rzrzgo,t5_2s23e,but this numbness is especially new to me and I really dont know whats causing it as I havent experienced this before
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,Some sound advice from my friend Apologies if this doesnt help
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,but it really helped me
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,I was having a really bad day
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,in a lot of emotional and mental pain
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,and talking to my friend about it
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,Our conversation went like  Me Nobody understands how I feel
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,Do you understand how I feel
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,to be honest I dont understand how you feel right now
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,But I used to
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,I have been to a very similar place that you are in now and felt a very similar pain
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,I dont right now
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,And you know what that means
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,It means how youre feeling is transient
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,It has the ability to come and go
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,as it has done for me countless of times
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,Understanding the nature of it really helped me calm down
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,I guess the only constant we can be sure of is that things change
s22jbq,t5_2tyg2,and this helped me detach from my psychosis

rewjev,t5_2s1h9,I was put on Keppra
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,was very quickly was well controlled
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,and have maintained excellent control
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,My brother has never been fully controlled
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,but he lives in CA a mandated reporting state so he cant tell his doctors without the state pulling his license
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,He was put on Depakote first but his liver values spiked he struggles with alcohol and substance use
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,so he was transitioned to Keppra
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,he was hospitalized for a week in NYC and weaned off Keppra and loaded on Vimpat
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,Hes done well for over a year
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,with fewer breakthroughs
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,Three days ago he had an aura
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,and this morning
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,hes had two grand malstonic clonics
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,He usually lives alone
rewjev,t5_2s1h9,but were all currently together for family vacation

snt80b,t5_2tyg2,but since Ive been pretty desorientated trough my thoughts
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,because of the desorganization of its
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,I just wanted to have someone who tell me its normal   I became so paranoid before
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,and after the psychosis
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,so this type of thoughts appear like  times a day
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,I dont know if this is normal
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,Sometimes I am not aware of what I am thinking
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,and other times I am thinking too fast and maybe in more than one thing at the time
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,and that still scared me
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,I just wanted to put it in words to feel lighter
snt80b,t5_2tyg2,Thanks for reading

sesq6s,t5_2r876,One of my twin boys is suspected of CF
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Looking for any stories or help to prepare
sesq6s,t5_2r876,First time posting on Reddit and first time having a deep dive in to CF
sesq6s,t5_2r876,So one of my twins had to get rushed for the operation known as Meconium IIeas which is a sign of CF
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Needless to say I have been up since gathering all the information I can
sesq6s,t5_2r876,I know drs say not to worry but I ignorantly hadnt heard of CF
sesq6s,t5_2r876,His screen test came back negative but they want to do genetic testing
sesq6s,t5_2r876,I was wondering if any of you had experienced a false negative or false positive even
sesq6s,t5_2r876,His twin is showing no signs and was born nearly double the size of his suspected CF brother
sesq6s,t5_2r876,I have read some inspiring stuff on here and else where and if CF it is so be it
sesq6s,t5_2r876,we will make it normal and enjoy every day
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Modern medicine is amazing after all
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Hope Ive not broken any rules
sesq6s,t5_2r876,thank you for reading and any comments are welcome
sesq6s,t5_2r876,I should note my twins are premature
sesq6s,t5_2r876, weeks delivery
sesq6s,t5_2r876,UPDATE  I dont know if many will see this but its crazy to look back on
sesq6s,t5_2r876,After all my little man does not have CF
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Thank you all for the words at the time
sesq6s,t5_2r876,I have since got involved with CF chairties as even though my little one doesnt have it
sesq6s,t5_2r876,awareness must be had
sesq6s,t5_2r876,I do want to out this out there for others that a meconium ileas doesnt always mean CF
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Took us months to get the genetic testing back
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Stoma is now reversed which involved another emergency surgery after The reversal went wrong
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Were on the other side now hopefully
sesq6s,t5_2r876,Thanks again for all the interaction on this post when I was at a very vulnerable time
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,Sighing a lot unconsciously Does anyone else have this thing
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,I sigh multiple times a day without knowing it or thinking of anything in particular
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,I think my body might be doing it to regulate my breath
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,because I suffer from irregular breathing due to POTS
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,But I am not sure
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,Ive noticed that the sighs force me to take a deep breath right after
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,So this is my theory
skdgpb,t5_2saq9,Is it just a me thing or do others do the same
shnv7t,t5_2tyg2,Able to sleep ok every night

shnv7t,t5_2tyg2,PTSD can make you have a bad insomnia
shnv7t,t5_2tyg2,I didnt sleep in a very long time and ended up I had psychosis

s4iovt,t5_2rtve,I have bad anxiety so I always think of the worst outcome especially reading thing online

s4iovt,t5_2rtve,Or if someone with lupus could even get this treatment
s4iovt,t5_2rtve,govtreatmentstreatmentlocator  Thank you for any advice you guys give me
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,Does anyone else here have a habit of sending out mass emails
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,I have emailed or contacted intelligence agencies
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,many news organizations even cults
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,millitas and hospitals as well as doctors   I almost never get return emails or messages but I once got an email back from the secretary of a famous pastor who will remain unnamed
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,after I rambled on for several and I mean several emails about my religious andor psychotic beliefs which escalated to the point of me asking him to collar me   And most people even if they talk to me initially will cut contact after I tell them Im psychotic although exceptions include a cult and current andor former individuals engaged in illegal activities as well as a Christian church which was fine talking to me even when I mentioned my desire to be made a eunuch so I could be communally enslaved by the church leadership
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,although apparently this can be spoken of and yet psychosis can not be   Its gotten to such an extreme extent I often wonder how many times and with what information mental health andor the police have been contacted about me without me realizing it    I feel my psychosis isnt the simple answer for why I do these things though
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,My issues with psychosis began because I once prayed asking God for help from someone at my youth group due to a lifetime of abuse the worst of which was years of forced isolation and so when Im in crisis I still to this day despite being an adult will be looking for a saviour when things are hellish for me   I once even contacted a goverment referall line within the last year or so begging to be given a legal guardian as an adult so I could have a family and the lady was dumb struck and made me feel increadibly stupid for even asking the question   It seems to me despite our constant cries for help we will be ignored by the vast majority of pretty much everyone
sc6ph9,t5_2tyg2,Sort of like that time I tried to find a counsellor on pride counselling and they asked me for a list of like five possible therapists for them to contact about me being their patient and they literally all refused my case and then one lady came forward who wasnt even an option on the list and did it but even then I had no money to keep it going beyond a month
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,Going more in depth with what happened last night So I was on my second dose of paxil
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,which they now think Im allergic to it
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,I lost all of last night
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,I dont know how to explain it
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,I feel guilt
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,I was going hot and cold and at one point my fiance put some water in my hair and I apparently slapped him and tried to gouge his eye out because I was terrified of being drugged with PCP and cyanide by my ex step dad
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,I had told my fiance that he needed to remember a code that my mom says it sounds familiar
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,the letters were  and my mom things I was trying to call out for help with it being close to  I think
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,And I ate a lot
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,and specifically wanted  waffles
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,but he just got my normal choice at waffle house in which he said I ate most of it
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,But at one point I was yelling out in pain as I said that my brain hurts
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,my sister honestly didnt believe any of this was going on until she saw me in person and my mom was afraid because this is worse than any patient she has had under PCPpsychosis
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,That theyre surprised Im here mentally now
s6c9t8,t5_2tyg2,It was so scary
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Photosensitivity sucks LED lights mess with my head so badly and its a massive problem for me because all the lighting is going LED
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Avoiding looking at them is not the solution because being in a room lit by LED or even just walking by an LED light will make my brain starts its sh
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,I dont know what it is about them that affects me
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,all I know is that they make my life rather difficult
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Any other photosensitive folks have a problem with them
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Have you found anything to help
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Thanks for the responses
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,After doing a bit of googling it seems that LED lights are a known trigger for photosensitive epileptics
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Some governments are instituting manufacturing standards requiring the lights to operate above the safe level of hz
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Unfortunately there isnt an international uniform standard
rvietg,t5_2s1h9,Im going to talk to my neuro and see if she has any ideas andor if she can refer my to an ophthalmologist who can prescribe tinted glasses to lessen the effect of LEDs

smz1j1,t5_2s23e,How worried should I be
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,So Im just wondering about your experiences with covid
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,Long story short I was diagnosed officially in November 
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,got my first dose of Rituximab in December  but I got my two covid vaccine shots during the summer  so a few months before starting my treatment
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,I am going in Romania in  as part of some Erasmus program for a very interesting project and the risk of getting covid is obviously quite high
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,Of course Ill be very careful but the risk is still existent and I was wondering about how worried should I be if I were to get covid
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,Have you guys gotten covid while on B-cells depleting medications
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,And if so
smz1j1,t5_2s23e,how bad was it

riev5a,t5_2s1h9,Severe loss of appetite on Keppra Hi everyoneIve recently started taking Keppra at a low dose for the last  weeks or soamongst other unpleasant side effects is the striking loss of appetite complete disinterest in food
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,Its quite bizzarre
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,and Ive lost kgs over  weeks since starting and I am slim to begin with
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,I cant seem to tolerate proper meals
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,and can only really do small snacks here and thereIve started exercising more to work up an appetite
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,and make it a priority to include some sort of protein source with every snack to offset the inevitable muscle wasting
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,It looks like a lot of other people here are in the same boatan excellent resource that Ive found helpful is any dietary advice given to patients having chemosmall frequent high protein snacks as tolerated
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,An example  Protein intake and cancerhttpswww
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,pdf  Im keen to stay on the keppra and see how the side effects gounpleasant
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,but better than violent nocturnal tonic clonics
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,Any other advice for surviving on Keppra would be much appreciatedIm quite new to all of this
riev5a,t5_2s1h9,and so far the only thing that stops me from going completely insane is exercising
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,How do you guys describe the Seizurey feeling you might get
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,Before I was diagnosed with absence seizures
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,I experienced this very specific feeling during one the only way I could describe it would be disorientation in the form of vague and blurry line markings like on google maps street view and sudden inability to comprehend wordspictures
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,Id assume this is maybe an aura
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,but it got me thinking about how hard it is to explain this feeling to a doctor
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,Its so hard to put into words how this experience feels
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,Aura often isnt enough to explain exactly whats happening
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,but saying what I said above makes no sense either
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,Sometimes I just feel off all day
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,with this weird feeling
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,I believe my meds have stopped working as Ive gotten this feeling
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,which was only present before medication
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,very often all of a sudden
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,Im booked in to see my neurologist
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,but wanted to be able to explain what Im experiencing better too
rhqp9l,t5_2s1h9,How do you guys explain your seizurey feeling
s1z886,t5_2s23e,and eating disorders okay so im not really sure how to start this since its kinda just me talking about stuff i deal with
s1z886,t5_2s23e,to start off
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i have multiple sclerosis and two eating disorders
s1z886,t5_2s23e,gets overlooked when it comes to MS is the body image issues
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i gained a lot of weight due to multiple strong MS relapses
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i would eat normally
s1z886,t5_2s23e,but didnt have the strength to walk
s1z886,t5_2s23e,staying in bed most of the day
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i wasnt burning enough calories to maintain my weight so i gained weight
s1z886,t5_2s23e,ive had my eating disorders longer than ive had MS and thus came the downfall of my body image
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i got to my heaviest and i felt out of control
s1z886,t5_2s23e,control is the very thing that started and drives my eating disorders
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i see im losing control of my body and weight and i wont lie
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i feel helpless
s1z886,t5_2s23e,the average person would say okay well diet and workout
s1z886,t5_2s23e,but dieting triggers my eating disorder and anything stronger than walking makes me black out
s1z886,t5_2s23e,i decided to cut out fast food and sodas
s1z886,t5_2s23e,im noticing a change
s1z886,t5_2s23e,however i wont be weighing myself as i feel it would trigger me
s1z886,t5_2s23e,idk if this is a common feeling for others but i just wanted a space to talk about it
s1z886,t5_2s23e,thanks for listening
s7e8oc,t5_2tyg2,Does anybody else experience remembering things that fuel your delusions that may not have happened
s7e8oc,t5_2tyg2,I experience suddenly remembering things people said or did to me that they later completely deny
s7e8oc,t5_2tyg2,The remembering is usually triggered by seeing something related to it
s7e8oc,t5_2tyg2,It feels like the future influences my past
s7e8oc,t5_2tyg2,Just want to know if people have extremely real feeling false memories often

rhs9ys,t5_2rtve,Ive always had very low blood pressure  with a higher than average heart rate s
rhs9ys,t5_2rtve,It makes physical activity very difficult and accelerates feelings of fatigue
rhs9ys,t5_2rtve,has Wolf-Parkinsons White syndrome a usually manageable form of heart arrhythmia and Im planning on asking my doctor to test me for it
rhs9ys,t5_2rtve,I was curious if there was a trend in the lupus and autoimmune community with heart abnormalities that could indicate other issues
rhs9ys,t5_2rtve,lupus specifically can cause many severe heart complications
rhs9ys,t5_2rtve,but as someone without any urgent scares related to my heart
rhs9ys,t5_2rtve,I was curious if other peoples stats were similar to mine
sxry7v,t5_2r876,I would love to get some inputs on whether my  year-old son should get the Covid  booster
sxry7v,t5_2r876,In the European country where we live
sxry7v,t5_2r876,boosters are not available for those under 
sxry7v,t5_2r876,In the country we come from
sxry7v,t5_2r876,which we are visiting right now
sxry7v,t5_2r876,kids his age can get the booster
sxry7v,t5_2r876,He was diagnosed with CF two years ago
sxry7v,t5_2r876,after two episodes of acute pancreatitis
sxry7v,t5_2r876,His diagnosis is atypical CF and it is mostly GI problems he deals with
sxry7v,t5_2r876,He has also had a lung infection that cleared with antiobiotics and some wheezing in cold weather
sxry7v,t5_2r876,His CF clinic invited him early for the vaccine due to his condition
sxry7v,t5_2r876,but there are no plans for booster since under s are not eligible
sxry7v,t5_2r876,And the WHO is saying that people under  do not need the booster
sxry7v,t5_2r876,He had Covid  in December 
sxry7v,t5_2r876,We have an appointment tomorrow for him to get the booster
sxry7v,t5_2r876,But now I am having second thoughts
sxry7v,t5_2r876,I am curious about what others have done or what you would do in our situation
sxry7v,t5_2r876,Thanks for sharing your thoughts

s1vka5,t5_2s1h9,because it seems I cant go more than a week without masturbating now
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,can accidental pressure on abdomen cause immediate painhernia enlargementpermanent problems
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,Ive been diagnosed with HH and gerd which Im managing with moderate success
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,Tonight I was rolling the trash bin to the curb and the bin slipped and almost fell over
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,I strained to catch it from falling and titled it back upright
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,trying not to put pressure on my core muscles
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,It didnt even feel like it was that much weight on my body
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,more of an awkward balancing act
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,but a few minutes later I am feeling pain in my diaphragm region and shortness of breath the breathing symptom is something I get a lot unfortunately
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,I usually so careful
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,I am worried that I may have enlarged my hernia andor permanently increased my symptom severity
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,is that even possible
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,I keep thinking of my hernia as this small tear in my diaphragm
rs0wgd,t5_2qlaa,and I have this constant visual in my head of bending at the wrong angle one day and the whole thing splitting open like Winnie the Poohs ass when he sings up down touch the ground
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Im nervous to start PPI So two weeks ago I f was diagnosed with costochondritis and told to take ibuprofen X daily for  days
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Towards the end of the nd day
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,I developed pretty bad heartburn for a few hours
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,but I dismissed it thinking it was chest pain from making my costochondritis worse by carrying heavy bags
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,The next day I developed bad heartburn again for  hours and again dismissed it until that night when my fiance pointed out that it might be the ibuprofen causing heartburn
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,I immediately stopped taking ibuprofen but have been dealing with the repercussions ever since
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,My entire GI was messed up for several days
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,I thought Id have to go to the ER a couple of times
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,and the one time I took a small dose of Mylanta THAT caused the worst cramping Ive ever felt in my life
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,It also gave me weird brain fog and chills
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,so Ive been very nervous to take it or any other antacid again
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Ive been getting better
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Ive been eating only alkaline foods
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,sipping ginger tea
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,anything that might help naturally
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Three days ago was the first day I wasnt constantly in pain
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,but I still have a fairly constant burning sensation in my esophagus
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,lots of burping
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,and occasional esophageal pseudo-dyspnea
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,I saw a doctor today and he prescribed an Omeprazole titration  mg X daily for two weeks
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,X daily for two weeks
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,every other day for two weeks
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Then well go from there
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Now that I know what it is
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Ive realized Ive experienced some minor esophageal burning and pseudo-dyspnea in the past
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,and I may have finally pushed my body over the edge into full-on acid reflux
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,I know theres probably nothing to worry about with this PPI
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,but Ive been getting more and more medication anxious over the past couple of years
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,I also have Multiple Sclerosis and take steroids at least X year
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,and one thing Im concerned about is my increased risk for osteoporosis
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Im also someone who typically does get side effects with medication
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,so Im worried my body might be one of the rare unlucky ones with PPI as well
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Does anyone have some advice to assuage my fears
rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,Has anyone experienced something similar
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,Embarrassing Conversation I have suffered from a hiatal hernia for about three years now
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,As a result
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,my breath has become terrible
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,The minute I eat ANYTHING my breath changes for the worst
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,I started seeing my boyfriend about  months ago and I know hes smelled my breath
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,I want to have the awkward conversation about why my breath is the way it is but I just dont know how to go about it
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,I really like this person but Im just so embarrassed
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,I dont want him thinking I practice poor oral hygiene but no amount of toothpaste
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,mouthwash or flossing will help
rmr342,t5_2qlaa,How should I initiate this embarrassing conversation and what should I say

sr30xw,t5_2s23e,And I have my own issues that are exacerbated by cold
sr30xw,t5_2s23e,doctors and treatment availability is important

pl81fo,t5_2syer,Gout or RA or both
pl81fo,t5_2syer,My husband has been a gout sufferer for years
pl81fo,t5_2syer,with attack frequency averaging - times per year
pl81fo,t5_2syer,Due to careless primary care physicians
pl81fo,t5_2syer,he was taken off allopurinol years ago and managed his flares mainly with Prednisone and colchicine
pl81fo,t5_2syer,in the last year his gout has become particularly debilitating
pl81fo,t5_2syer,striking literally every couple of weeks
pl81fo,t5_2syer,He was finally seen by a good rheumatologist who put him back on mg of allo
pl81fo,t5_2syer,That was some  months ago
pl81fo,t5_2syer,He was prepared to experience flares while getting used to allo
pl81fo,t5_2syer,but they dont seem to let go at all
pl81fo,t5_2syer,Literally every time we have a few days of rainy humid weather
pl81fo,t5_2syer,he gets a flare across multiple joints his hands
pl81fo,t5_2syer,We live in the Northeast with unstable weather
pl81fo,t5_2syer,so hes been ridden with severe inflammation every couple of weeks for - days
pl81fo,t5_2syer,The rheumatologist says they need to measure his UA when hes not having a flare to see if he needs a higher dose of allo
pl81fo,t5_2syer,but it seems like hes in the midst of one continuous attack
pl81fo,t5_2syer,How common is it for gout sufferers to be so weather dependent
pl81fo,t5_2syer,Could this be rheumatoid arthritis on top of gout

sgc8vd,t5_2tyg2,I had this psychosis going on
sgc8vd,t5_2tyg2,But however my story was that I was diagnosed with mania but then schizophrenia and not leaning tendency towards autism spectrum disorder

rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,Feeling so much anxiety right now   Im feeling really afraid and alone right now
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,Its am and Im supposed to be sleeping
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,The day before I didnt sleep until am because I was having a panic attack about what if this could be something worse
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,but since then I do think its related to my esophagus instead
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,My sister is in medical school and thinks I have gerd
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,Ive been having symptoms for a week now and Im confused if this is my fate
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,Is it considered gerd if its been going on for only one week
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I dont have anyone who can empathize to talk to about this
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,my dad thinks Im overreacting and that I did this to myself
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I have anxiety issues and have had health scares before like when I had covid and insisted on going to the hospital and felt I was having trouble breathing
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,but my lungs were fine and hes just done with it
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I feel pressure behind my breast bone on the right and sometimes it feels like it goes to the left 
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I tried to ignore it and tried to chew my food more
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,because when I dont chew my food I feel as if it got caught in my chest
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I took too many antacids the first day and just assumed it would go away on its own
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,First getting used to tinnitus and now this  I had really spicy food last Saturday and then last Sunday I tried my friends soup and that night I couldnt sleep
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I felt a bit of liquid escaping from my stomach and going into my mouth and it wasnt fully acidic it was pretty watered down
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,and since then my problems started
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I havent taken naproxen in a long time but I wonder if I damaged my body in the past from not eating enough food taking it
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I didnt really experience acid reflux too much and when I did it wasnt annoying or I thought thats just normal after eating food sometimes
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,But I did notice for a few years my throat has been a bit raw feeling
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,never  perfect
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,My main concern is  Does the pressure of feeling like something is on top of your breastbone go away
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,And the feeling of food going down your esophagus
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,Should I be worried of hiatal hernia
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,How can I tell that I have that instead
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I only had bad acid reflux that day and I dont feel it now but I keep burping
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,but feels a lot more like air bubbles that dont give much relief
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,Is there a way for my esophagus to heal from this
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,Thank you to anyone who read this
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,And Im sorry if youre going through much worse symptoms than what I described and had to endure through all of this for years
rejsu0,t5_2qlaa,I wish I had someone to talk to about this

or6opq,t5_2syer,It seems more painful then first one I had
or6opq,t5_2syer,Its in the same toe joint I stopped colchicine few days ago because I felt I didnt need it anymore and I was getting better but clearly something triggered this attack
or6opq,t5_2syer,I had  glasses of wine yesterday
or6opq,t5_2syer,One around noon and one around -pm
or6opq,t5_2syer,thats the only trigger I can think of

sc1mak,t5_2s23e,Im not physically fit to work and cant get approved for disability
sc1mak,t5_2s23e,I have been let go from my past job as an electrician after I could no longer perform basic duties
sc1mak,t5_2s23e,Im currently on Ocrevus but am seeing no improvement or slowing of progress
sc1mak,t5_2s23e,I also just recently lost my health insurance and will not be able to receive my infusions
sc1mak,t5_2s23e,and to make matters worse my partner has told me recently that they didnt sign up for this and also said  its not my problem  and to figure it out away from our family
sc1mak,t5_2s23e,Im pretty sure losing my family would be the last straw for me
sc1mak,t5_2s23e,I dont feel like a MS warrior

smdto1,t5_2s3g1,Does smoking weed make your IBS feel better or worst
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,Ive read here people say Weed makes their IBS much better
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,But I read online that smoking can worsen your IBS
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,and it can irritate the digestive tract
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,In your experience does weed help or hurt you
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,Do you still have really bad IBS pain but are just high
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,Because if I still have peak IBS pain while being high I think that might just be too much stimulation for me and might cause a panic attack
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,Already the IBS pain almost puts me into a panic attack each time
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,I havent smoked in years
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,but for the most part I was never paranoid smoking marijuana but edibles always made me slightly paranoid and sometimes really paranoid
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,But Im starting to consider getting marijuana for the pain if it does indeed really help
smdto1,t5_2s3g1,But I dont want it to worsen my IBS

r9u5lz,t5_2syer,Breakthrough gout with low uric acid level I have been on mg allopurinol for a little over a year now
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,My uric acid level as of last August was 
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,Yet I still have gout flareups from time to time
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,My rheumatologist changed me to mg allo
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,I have colchicine for flares as well as prednisone which works well
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,What I dont understand is why
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,with such a low uric acid level
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,I get any flareups at all
r9u5lz,t5_2syer,When I went from 
r9u5lz,t5_2syer, four years ago non-medicated to 
r9u5lz,t5_2syer, now I thought that I should be just about immune to gout

su6w96,t5_2s23e,How well are you sleep these days
su6w96,t5_2s23e,So Ive been having problems sleeping
su6w96,t5_2s23e,Falling asleep at the usual time is no problem
su6w96,t5_2s23e,but lately Ive been waking up - hours later and cannot get back to sleep without getting up and doing something mundane for a few hours
su6w96,t5_2s23e,I then will wake up a few hours later to start my day and am dragging all day
su6w96,t5_2s23e,I know sleep is critical to managing MS and overall health in general
su6w96,t5_2s23e,but what I want to know is how typical this is
su6w96,t5_2s23e,For my fellow insomniacs
su6w96,t5_2s23e,does anything help particularly well
su6w96,t5_2s23e,How likely is it that a relapse is contributing to the problem
su6w96,t5_2s23e,Personally I doubt a root cause can be determined
su6w96,t5_2s23e,but maybe your experiences may help me narrow it down
su6w96,t5_2s23e,I try to adjust my sleeping habits and setup to help mitigate and it helps for a while but nothing seems to stick
su6w96,t5_2s23e,I look forward to reading your comments

sp2mim,t5_2s23e,I was diagnosed with MS on the th January 
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,I have read about the feeling which is described as MS hug but dont think Ive ever had that feeling before
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,Until a few days ago
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,where almost the whole top half of my body felt like the pain you feel when you experience a tight stitch in the sides of your ribs if you have been running too long
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,That exact feeling
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,just everywhere on my top half
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,This came and went for a few days and has now completely vanished
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,I had been doing no heavy lifting
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,no sports etc that would have caused this feeling
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,and I have never felt it before in my life
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,I supposed I could have pulled something and not known about it until after
sp2mim,t5_2s23e,I was just wondering if anyone that has experience an MS hug feeling would describe it the same way that I have

otbe9p,t5_2r876,Vertex initiate Phase  of next gen triple therapy to hopefully replace trikaftakaftrio News release httpsinvestors
otbe9p,t5_2r876,fbclid=IwARhnKSUwHYWfnQEjBAM-PgJKvIhMWIGPPvWLrsgjNpJPUyE  Quote from article   Phase  data demonstrated that a once-daily triple combination of VX- tezacaftorVX- has potential for enhanced clinical benefit compared to TRIKAFTA® elexacaftortezacaftorivacaftor and ivacaftor  Initiation of Phase  program expected in the second half of     VX-  TEZACAFTOR  VX- Vertex next triple therapy  An immediate benefit to this treatment is that VX- is deuterated ivacaftor and would replace normal ivacaftor Kalydeco and only needs to be taken once a day
otbe9p,t5_2r876,So I believe this entire next triple therapy would also only need to be taken once a day rather than TrikaftasKaftrios twice a day
otbe9p,t5_2r876,This may also help with people who struggle to take the -g of fat you are required to take with TrikaftaKaftrio as you would just take it with a big fatty main meal lunch or dinner
otbe9p,t5_2r876,VX- is supposed to be an improved version of elexacaftor
otbe9p,t5_2r876,Overall my hopes for this is an improved version TrikaftaKaftrio with fewer side effects and you only have to take it once a day

ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,retina disappearing so ive been diagnosed with ms in november last year when i went to hospital with complete losing sight in one eye and they put me on heavy steroids
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,im still waiting for my treatment mainly because of my retina in the eye disappearing
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,the doctors suspect another disease on top of ms
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,they are trying to figure it out before starting treatment
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,ive read a bit and asked few ms nurses around and they point to stargardt as a complication of inflammation on my optic nerve
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,my vision in one eye is somewhat blurry and discolored
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,kinda looks like the d filter of red green and blue noise when i look at things
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,the description matches stargardt in one of my eyes
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,its been fluctuating over few days
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,one day its almost normal sight and then again its blurry
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,its been present ever since ive been diagnosed with it and treated with steroids
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,they did photos of the back of my eye and since november when my retina was still present even though i lost sight in one eye completely
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,but over the passed few months when they did more photos my retina is almost completely gone
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,the doctors tell me its unfixable but i did find some stem cell procedures in poland that fix retina issues
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,basically transplant surgery using stem cells
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,i know my uncle had his retina fixed with this procedure
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,anyone else had sight issues with ms
ssr9xw,t5_2s23e,and did you get any surgery for it or fixed it somehow

scyuzs,t5_2tyg2,Kratom after psychosis I had cannabis induced psychosis a while back and Im wondering if anyone has any experience or insight into using kratom after psychosis
scyuzs,t5_2tyg2,It has stimulating effects in small doses and sedative effects in larger doses
scyuzs,t5_2tyg2,I think that it interacts with the opioid receptors in some way
scyuzs,t5_2tyg2,Would it be safe for me to take kratom or would it do damage
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,ADHD meds IR vs ER
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,After around  months of trying to figure out whats going on with me
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,I finally had a cardiologist tell me I most likely have POTS
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,Its not an official diagnosis yet
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,but its nice to have some headway
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,The only issue is I also have ADHD and in trying to manage it Ive found that pretty much every ADHD medication makes my tachycardia exponentially worse
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,Ive tried Vyvanse
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,and now Strattera and Im super tachycardic and short of breath on all of them so Ive been taken off all of them eventually I will say theyve all been generic save for the Vyvanse due to my insurance
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,I need some way of managing my ADHD
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,Has anyone had any luck with using IR Ritalin or Adderall rather than ER
ssg7ed,t5_2saq9,Or anything you found that didnt exacerbate tachycardia
spzc4r,t5_2s23e,I had a really bad relapse last March and lost a load of my vision
spzc4r,t5_2s23e,my doctor confirmed it as homonymous hemianopia and thought my vision should return once my inflammation was under control
spzc4r,t5_2s23e,well it didnt lol   Ive probably lost around  of my sight and I have no peripheral vision on my right side at all
spzc4r,t5_2s23e,Has anyone else had vision problems spontaneously resolve
spzc4r,t5_2s23e,Adjusting to being partially sighted has been really difficult and I rely mostly on my partner to help me get around outside
spzc4r,t5_2s23e,I was thinking of getting a partially sighted cane to let people know to give me a bit of space when walking about but I dont know if Ill qualify as theres a chance my eyesight can get better also major imposter syndrome lol  Also does anyone have any advice on gaining some of my independence back
oqbyct,t5_2r876,Cystic fibrosis and recreational drug use Yo guys    I am curious
oqbyct,t5_2r876,what drugs have you guys donechosen not to do
oqbyct,t5_2r876,I rarely drink alchohol
oqbyct,t5_2r876,not just bc of my CF but I dont enjoy the physical feeling of being drunk
oqbyct,t5_2r876,To me it just feels like youre a sloppy version of yourself with  less IQ points   At university I tried MDMA which was a slightly lifechanging experience
oqbyct,t5_2r876,Just pure euphoria without the debilitating pain of an alcohol hangover
oqbyct,t5_2r876,BY NO MEANS am I reccomended anything to anyone
oqbyct,t5_2r876,Ultimately anything in life has a high and low attached to it
oqbyct,t5_2r876,and  with 
oqbyct,t5_2r876,k people in this sub I guess we have some pretty diverse life experiences so I would love to know how people with the same condition as me  choose to navigate such choices

plufub,t5_2r876,Just got orkambi after  years of trying to get it
rvkeum,t5_2r876,Not asking for a diagnosis because Im pretty sure Ive figured out the problem
rvkeum,t5_2r876,but I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced the same thing I am
rvkeum,t5_2r876,Currently Im off Trikafta and have been for a little over a week now should be getting a new order in tomorrow
rvkeum,t5_2r876,the hospital was just being incompetent lol
rvkeum,t5_2r876,Yesterday I suddenly got some really intense abdominal pain
rvkeum,t5_2r876,This happened once before when I went of Trikafta
rvkeum,t5_2r876,as well as a few other times that may have been due to me going off of Orkambi
rvkeum,t5_2r876,It only happens every few months at most
rvkeum,t5_2r876,and I actually hadnt experienced it at ALL during 
rvkeum,t5_2r876,so Im pretty sure this type of pain only occurs when I go off those specific meds
rvkeum,t5_2r876,Anyone else have the same thing
rvkeum,t5_2r876,I tried to look into it online but I only saw stomach pain symptoms for people actively taking Trikafta which I thankfully never experienced

sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Tysabri is having an impact on my mental health
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,should I switch
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Background info Im F RRMS Brit
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,living in Europe
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Diagnosed last July  after what I suspect was around a year of emerging symptoms
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,MRI found  lesions in the brain and  in the spine
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,The docs arent sure if I was a long time untreated or just have rather aggressive attacks
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Therapy settled all my complaints and Ive been living so I think symptomless since then
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,I started Tysabri in September 
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,so  months now
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,I have it administered by my neuro at their practice every  weeks
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Scans show no changes and no active lesions so they want to keep me on it
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Im not doing so well with the healthlife balance
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,The injections are unpleasant but I can deal with that what I struggle with is the frequency of which I have to have them
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Im quite free spirited
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,I like to travel
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Im hoping to work nomadically
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,I like to move around
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,I really struggle with feeling like Im trapped
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,caught between enjoying my life and taking care of my condition
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,I feel like I cant be myself while Im tied to my neurologist like this
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,My thoughts are becoming intrusive and the deeper in the spiral I get the more I start to boil it down to numbers and stats
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Im increasingly worried about the risk of PML The hospital MS outpatients repeatedly lost my results
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,cancelled appointments and actually failed to advise me correctly before my diagnosis even when I had a scan that pointed to MS
sfttn8,t5_2s23e, which resulted in a trip to AE before I was admitted
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Im terrified that theyll miss something vital and the mistake could be fatal in this delicate situation
sfttn8,t5_2s23e,Has anyone else switched medication or does anyone have Tysabri and have the same feelingsworries
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,Plaquenil and hypoglycemia So I started Plaquenil weeks ago and it was going well but last week I noticed that I am getting hypoglycemic in the afternoons
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,Im so hungry and my hands start shaking
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,so I eat something and feel better
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,Is this a common reaction
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,As far as I know
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,I dont have diabetes but Ive had episodes of this before when I eat high sugar breakfasts like waffles and pancakes
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,so I never eat them anymore
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,I also dont eat sugar and simple carbs almost at all
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,But that doesnt seem to matter all of a sudden
r41y1n,t5_2rtve,Anyone have similar issues with Plaquenil
sqb9re,t5_2tyg2,Learning a new task or language might help

ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,Weird Stomach Discomfort and Advice I have had Gerd and acid reflux for a few years now but all of a sudden on Tuesday I had the worst acid reflux episode in my life
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,I took Pepto Bismol and nothing happened
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,Three hours later I found some Prilosec and I felt so much better
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,Afterwards I noticed this weird pain under my heart and diaphragm area but thankfully it went away
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,I tried calling my gastroenterologist but he wont see me unless I get an H pylori and Hepatitis A test which I had immunizations for
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,He told me to go off of Prilosec or any proton pump inhibitor for  weeks to take the test
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,The problem is this morning I have a lot of discomfort and I honestly dont know what is wrong with me
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,Whenever I drink water I feel like I want to vomit the same with exercising
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,I also wake up feeling full and my stomach burns
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,I notice when I eat something it goes away
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,I really wish I had another endoscopy again because something does not feel right
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences before
ryzyj8,t5_2qlaa,What can i take to help with relief thats not an proton pump inhibitor
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,What exactly is a malar rash
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,Asking because I have been having what appears to be one occasionally for a couple weeks now but I am genuinely not sure if its actually lupus-related or caused by something else
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,For reference I am ANA positive and have many symptoms of lupus such as hair loss
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,joint pain etc but not diagnosed
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,I get it in the mornings when I wake up sometimes
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,but I notice I usually get it when I am stressed or wearing a mask
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,It only stays for a few minutes to a few hours and I would say it happens every two or three days on average
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,It doesnt hurt or itch or burn and it isnt raised
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,which is the main reason I am not quite sure
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,And its noticeable
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,but not extreme
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,Mostly covers my cheeks
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,with a little redness on my nose and forehead
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,stops right at the nasolabial fold
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,What exactly causes a malar rash
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,How long is it there
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,Is there any way to distinguish an autoimmunelupus malar rash from general facial redness besides a skin biopsy
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,Is there anything else that causes this
rk4nak,t5_2rtve,such as vitamin D deficiency which I definitely have a severe one

pbdkln,t5_2r876,I currently work full time as a teacher though
pbdkln,t5_2r876,I think perhaps you have to be fully disabled
pbdkln,t5_2r876,Is this true

qabbzb,t5_2r876,Not into eugenics etc but Id like CF to exit the family gene pool
qabbzb,t5_2r876,Was having a conversation about the reason Im not in any rush to have kids and it wouldnt bother me or upset me if I never had them
qabbzb,t5_2r876,Im  so Im still in the thinking stage but Im not very into the idea of having kids
qabbzb,t5_2r876,I said if I dont have kids and none of my siblings or cousins pass down the gene then CF could be basically deleted from the family gene pool and prevent any sick kids down the line
qabbzb,t5_2r876,My mum said it sounds a bit like eugenics
qabbzb,t5_2r876,I guess she can think what she likes
qabbzb,t5_2r876,But I dont think irradicating the CF gene is an evil thing
qabbzb,t5_2r876,CF is a horrible chronic disease
qabbzb,t5_2r876,Its best to try and prevent someone being born with something that will likely kill them before they even get close to middle age or even in childhood right
qabbzb,t5_2r876,I dont think CF and diseases alike it would be particularly missed
qabbzb,t5_2r876,Im not into the idea of stopping people with CF having kids its just a thought I had regarding my own bloodline

s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,How would you describe psychosis to someone who hasnt experienced it
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Based on your own history For me it was almost as if things were speed up like an old vcr
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Also theres this strange experience where no matter what happens in your immediate surrounding it seems like its a coded message given to you
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Example I got a note for a swimming party at my apartment and thought it meant I was being followed by police
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,I also heard voices but they werent really talking to me
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,It was more like hearing someone in the room over
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Music was very strange too
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,No matter what the lyric was it felt like a deep and profound message in ways that Ive never experienced music before
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Example thought my phone was controlled by the FBI so when I hit shuffle theyd send me a warning through the song
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,As far as visual hallucinations its hard to say because I think I experienced those during my blackout memory
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,I do remember seeing a big vault in the hospital that wasnt there later
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Im curious if these are similar to your experiences
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Edit I will also say for those that have had psychedelic experiences
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,It is a similar except theres no real enjoyable part of the experience
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,When youre tripping you know youre tripping
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,When youre in psychosis you cant tell when it happens
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Ill also say that psychedelic trips are more of a spiritual eye opening type experience whereas psychosis is more like your brain coming up with false scenarios and beliefs
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,Like imagine all those fake scenarios you think of about people talking about you when youre not around
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,But suddenly you believe theyre real
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,I also forgot to mention I had this internal sensation of falling apart literally
s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,  Also the person who mentioned it feels like extreme deja vu nailed it

slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,Pressure under sternum Does anyone get pressure like directly under their sternum
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy recently to rule anything major out plus multiple blood tests
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,my GI nor  other doctors didnt seem concerned about my symptoms
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,When Im stressed I seem to get more stomach issues
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,bits of nausea
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,this fluttering sensation below the sternum as well
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,Commonly it feels like theres something pushing on the tail of my sternum or xiphoid
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,I still belch quite a bit
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,theres never like pain just pressure and bits of nausea
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,Certain things will trigger a flare-up it seems tho spice and some alcohol are a one-way ticket to a bad night of dry heaving and stomach burning
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,so I dont touch that stuff
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,Not sure if what Im dealing with is just awful reflux possibly GERD
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,Pepcid and antacids help with belching and reflux
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,But they really mess with my stomach so Im not crazy about taking loads of that stuff
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,Getting pretty exhausted as stress causes stomach issues
slk3a4,t5_2s3g1,and stomach issues seem to just cause more stress

sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,Trial of the Eyes I find drawn to calling my psychosis adventure by the name of Trial of the Eyes
sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,Its based on Trial of the Grasses which is an ordeal ordinary people go through to become a powerful being called a Witcher

sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,also from the Netflix show Witcher
sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,also from the book series called Witcher

sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,Im not seeing myself as having special powers
sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,but I do see myself as capable of attending to challenges in my life
sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,I can do normal human feats never thought possible by me like get a girlfriend
sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,be a pronounced member of a church
sfimsj,t5_2tyg2,lead  organize an event for church

rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,ALL doctors told me its  anxiety and panic attacks
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,when i dont have these twitches I sleep like a baby
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,my life is the same as  months ago
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa, year ago etc
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,I may have ongoing stress from various issues
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,but I got used to it
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,Could it be nervous system burn out
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,I work a lot and have relatively little relaxation
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,Can my condition originate from the GERD
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,When it started I ate a lot of chocolate and citrus fruits
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,other than that my diet is rather on a healthy side not too much or too little of all kinds of foods
rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,I will be grateful for your help
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,and high meat consumption
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,may increase risks for MS
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,study shows If you eat a lot of meat
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,you may be at increased risk for multiple sclerosis
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,a new study suggests
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,MS is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulation around nerves
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,Its not clear what triggers the attack
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,but mounting evidence suggests bacteria plays a role
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,Gut bacteria can affect the immune system
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,and diet influences gut bacteria
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,To learn more about the interplay of diet
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,the immune system and MS
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,researchers studied  MS patients and  people without the disease
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,  We found a number of gut bacteria associated with MS and severity of disability of MS patients
si3xr0,t5_2s23e, said study author Dr
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,an assistant professor of medicine at UConn Health School of Medicine in Farmington
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,We also found increased autoimmune markers and signature metabolites in MS
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,But what is really interesting is how these systems connect with each other
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,and how diet is involved in these connections
si3xr0,t5_2s23e, Zhou said in a University of Connecticut news release
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,having lower levels of certain bacteria in the gut
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,and more of certain immune cells in the blood were all associated with MS
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,according to the report published online recently in the journal EBioMedicine
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,which was found in the MS patients
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,was linked with lower gut levels of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicrona bacteria involved with digesting carbohydrates from vegetables
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,  Higher meat consumption was also related to an increase in T-helper  cells in the immune system
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,and an increase in S-adenosyl-L-methionine SAM in the blood
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,The researchers said the findings suggest that in people with MS
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,something disconnects their gut bacteria from the immune system
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,resulting in autoimmune attacks on the nervous system
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,This sequence tends to be associated with meat-eating
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,According to study author Dr
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,This is the first study using an integrated approach to analyze the interplay between diet
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,the immune system and metabolism and their contribution to MS development
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,Piccio is an associate professor of neurology at the University of Sydney who was previously at Washington University School of Medicine in St
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,  The authors want to expand their research to include more people
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,including patients with a more severe form of MS
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,The aim is to learn more about the interaction of diet
si3xr0,t5_2s23e,gut bacteria and the immune system in MS to possibly prevent the disease or ease symptoms
sgjqdf,t5_2tyg2,Who else has agoraphobia after their psychosis
sgjqdf,t5_2tyg2,I have horrible agoraphobia
sgjqdf,t5_2tyg2,It just started developing recently and I hate it
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,Need some help with diagnosis IBS symptoms
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,First I wanted to thank you for your time ahead of reading this post it is going to be a long and whiny one where I really need help from all of you the IBS experts
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1, in determining if what I am suffering from is IBS related
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I will go in depth about my symptoms
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,In mid December I started noticing a few instances where I had constipated stools hard balls never happened to me before
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1, but not tied to any kind of pain and seemed to resolve itself
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,On Christmas Day
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I came down with a fever of 
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1, for the day and had stomach pain that seemed linked to constipation  gas until January 
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I started to feel better until I got my booster shot Pfizer on January 
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,After that began my personal hell
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I felt lower back pain  cramping and a stabbing in my low abdomen the next day that gradually became worse until the th
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I got my period on the th
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,so I thought maybe it was related to that but Advils which I usually take were not working
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I went into the ER on the th and was told it could be Endo and given Naproxen
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,My pain subsided a bit over the course of the next few days
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,just a weird feeling in my low abdomen
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,A week later my pain started escalating
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,My doctor did an Xray and found moderate fecal loading so I started laxatives which seemed to clear me out but also gave me extreme stomach cramps
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,My pain started to get worse it felt like I was being stabbed in my lower abdomen into my back
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,After a few days I went back to the hospital
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,They did an ultrasound and found everything to be normal said it could be IBS and sent me on my way
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,That entire week last week I could not sleep because the pain was so severe
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I was taking Tylenol
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,and Tylenol  with no relief or comfort
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,It was the week from hell
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I had another ultrasound where they found signs of a kidney stone  hydronephrosis kidney swelling and told me to go back to the ER
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I was relieved because I thought the cause of my pain was found turns out the CT scan they did showed nothing
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I have been given back a diagnosis of IBS
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I also had a stool test and multiple blood tests done all clear with no signs of infection or parasites
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,All my organs are healthy and functioning normally
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,my pain has gotten better
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,but it is not gone
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I am feeling a constant pressure  pain all along my low abdomen
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,having weird bowel movements soft and lots of small sausage pieces not like the big normal logs before this episode
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,The only thing that seems to relieve this pressure  pain is when I am walking around or standing otherwise if I am sitting or lying down it is all I can feel or think about
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,My doctor has recommended therapy for stress which I am also trying
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I have been referred to a GI and GYNO
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,but there are long waiting lists here
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,so no clue when I will get in
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I have been doing a multitude of diets low FODMAP
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,cutting out wheat  dairy
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,and bland foods
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,Lots of water
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,Started a probiotic Renew Life
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,psyllium husk capsules
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,apple cider vinegar gummies
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,Im at wits end trying to get through my daily life I know it has only been a bit over a month but it feels like this pain will never go away  I am going crazy  driving everyone around me crazy
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,I would love to hear any advice  personal opinions  recommendations on where to go from here
sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,Thank you so much

skv8hd,t5_2rtve,Potential Lupus Nephritis I noticed blood in my wee
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,It just started tonight and its a lot
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,Looks like cranberry juice
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,My blood pressure is quite high and I am on mg if amlodopine to help with that
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,I have also just been started on Ramipril as well for the high blood pressure
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,I have no idea what to do
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,GP isnt open on weekends and my Rheumatologist has an appointment with me in  days
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,The only way I can contact Rheumatology is through the helpline but it isnt manned on the weekends and right now is Saturday morning
skv8hd,t5_2rtve,Also I have COVID so Im isolating as well
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,Are these symptoms of IBS
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1, F Ive had intermittent rectal bleeding for almost  years
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,but for the last  months
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,it is every single time I go to the bathroom without fail
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,In the stool and on the paper
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,A few times have been quite a lot of blood
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,I also have a TON of mucus when I wipe
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,Sometimes it feels like I cant empty my bowels all the way
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,Im having pretty painful abdominal pain everyday
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,Ive been getting some mild nausea
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,I have been feeling fatigue for months
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,Idk if this is related at all
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,but I literally fainted in the shower today
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,and no I didnt have to too hot
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,Does this sound like IBS
sldcwz,t5_2s3g1,I have a consult set up for a gastroenterologist in March
sc68w7,t5_2saq9,Issues with salt Hello  does anyone have issues with their stomach due to salt
sc68w7,t5_2saq9,I have just started the POTS journey and was advised by my cardiologist to increase salt intake
sc68w7,t5_2saq9,I am finding that increasing it has caused me to have pretty severe stomach pains
sc68w7,t5_2saq9,I also have reflux and think it may be causing issues
sc68w7,t5_2saq9,Anyone else experienced this
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,Do You tell people you work with
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,Sometimes I have no choice but to say
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,Im having GI issues
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,then nobody asks for details
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,At other times its causing me to be late for work or have to run out quickly but Ive never bothered to tell anyone at work that its a chronic problem
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,Sometimes I think I should
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,but I dont
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,If I did
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,Id just say GI issues or something because who wants to discuss the details and it makes it sound more like a disease
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,The only reason Id consider it is that sometimes it can affect my schedule
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,make me need to leave or make me late
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,Its always worst when Im in a hurry
sslurz,t5_2s3g1,Then again it would probably just sound like an excuse anyway
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,Does this sound like GERD
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,Basically I feel nauseous very easily
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,There also seems to be a connection to stress
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,For example before Christmas I had to take a break from coffee because I got heartburn and nausea right away
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,Normally I can drink a cup or two and be fine
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,I also cant drink soda many days in a row etc
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,I also often find myself nauseous bc its too long since last meal which I would guess is normal but I feel like sometimes it happens too easily
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,I very rarely actually throw up
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,but Im sensitive to feeling sick so I often end up sitting in the bathroom
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,Which obviously sucks
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,The connection to stress is obviously very nasty since many nice things involve stress and then it brings this on
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,Also motion sickness lingers even though I read its supposed go away after the cause is eliminated
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,Not sure if that can be related tho
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,Anyway somebody said this sounds like acid reflux
rz4uuo,t5_2qlaa,so Im interested if someone has any insight
scopcj,t5_2saq9,As the title states
scopcj,t5_2saq9,does anyone else have nocturnal tachycardia
scopcj,t5_2saq9,I used to have fairly bad episodes of this pre beta-blocker
scopcj,t5_2saq9,and since then I have only experienced it a handful of times
scopcj,t5_2saq9,Ill go to sleep like normal
scopcj,t5_2saq9,but wake up every - minutes in a sweat and feeling like I ran a marathon
scopcj,t5_2saq9,usually also feeling fairly dehydrated
scopcj,t5_2saq9,Then Ill drift off back to sleep because Im exhausted
scopcj,t5_2saq9,then it happens all over again for a few hours at most
scopcj,t5_2saq9,Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing a similar thing
p2wsxr,t5_2r876,Double dose trikafta I think I might have just accidentally taken a double dose of my morning dose of trikafta so four tablets as I couldnt remember if I had taken them already or not

sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,Anyone prescribed folinic acid
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,Saw my rhuem yesterday  he prescribed me folinic acid to take twice a week
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,Im currently on hydroxychloroquine
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,prednisone as needed  weekly injections of benlysta
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,When I took the script to the pharmacy today I got a weird reaction  they asked what Im being treated for which was strange
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve, said theyre gonna give my doctor a call
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,They need to order it so I wont get it until tomorrow evening
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,I totally trust my doctor however Im mostly just wondering if anyone would know why they would react that way
sdk8q5,t5_2rtve,Its left me a little unsettled
psdcy1,t5_2r876,Fosfomycin Has anyone had this
psdcy1,t5_2r876,I was meant to try Ceftazidime avibactam but there was stock issues so now Im on fosfomycin
psdcy1,t5_2r876,Ive developed bad muscle aches  temps
psdcy1,t5_2r876,Im also on it with mero
psdcy1,t5_2r876,tobra  colo
psdcy1,t5_2r876,So a hefty abx overload this time
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He wont accept help or acknowledge his psychosis
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Hes low functioning
smascq,t5_2tyg2,cannot have a conversation
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He cant leave the house without getting lost
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Because he wont get help
smascq,t5_2tyg2,I cannot handle taking care of both him and myself
smascq,t5_2tyg2,How do I get him to wake up from this nightmare
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Some days hes nonverbal
smascq,t5_2tyg2,But he laughs hysterically all day
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He barely sleeps
smascq,t5_2tyg2,and when he does sleep
smascq,t5_2tyg2,we cant wake him up
smascq,t5_2tyg2,We thought at first he was just being a dick
smascq,t5_2tyg2,but we realized he had a very very serious processing disorder when it came to speaking with anyone
smascq,t5_2tyg2,You could ask him the same question
smascq,t5_2tyg2,various different ways
smascq,t5_2tyg2,and hed just look straight through you
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Nothing snaps him out of it
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Last night he spent from pm-am pacing around the basement talking about the mafia
smascq,t5_2tyg2,When he goes on his rants
smascq,t5_2tyg2,we are literally unable to get him to stop
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Weve been patient
smascq,t5_2tyg2,but Ive yelled at him to be quiet while I was on a phone call and he didnt even react like I was even there
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Every day he sits on the couch
smascq,t5_2tyg2,stares at the wall
smascq,t5_2tyg2,and laughs hysterically every  minutes or so
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He has no problem eating or using the bathroom
smascq,t5_2tyg2,but forget asking him to do any favors for you
smascq,t5_2tyg2,or make any sort of effort
smascq,t5_2tyg2,This was all brought on by long time meth usage
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He doesnt hear stuff anymore
smascq,t5_2tyg2,but hes been hospitalized for being physically threatening  times now
smascq,t5_2tyg2,For some reason he gets out of inpatient the day he gets in
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He can easily tell you the correct date
smascq,t5_2tyg2,where he is
smascq,t5_2tyg2,But then he will follow it up with an intricate story about how he survived a drive by shooting playing in a sandbox when he was  years old with me and my mom and some snakes
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Oh and hes medication non-compliant
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He will RAGE if we ask him to take his antipsychotics
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Hes convinced theyre poison tbh im on them too and i hate them but its the only way i function
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He will scream at strangers saying they killed the sandy hook kids
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He wont move from the checkout line after finishing
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He has to be reminded to get off the toilet after pooping
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Or leaving the shower
smascq,t5_2tyg2,We tell him he needs to see a psychiatrist but he says every time Huh
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Nothings wrong with me
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Maybe YOU need to be hospitalized
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Hes tried to escape multiple times from the hospital
smascq,t5_2tyg2,I feel like this all boils down to two things  
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He is extremely psychotic 
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He has a complete mental block stopping him from becoming self aware about his mental illness
smascq,t5_2tyg2,So much so that he broke off our engagement
smascq,t5_2tyg2,and regressed to being  years old and screamed when a doctor told him what was going wrong with him
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Before all of this
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Picture perfect man
smascq,t5_2tyg2,year complicated IT job
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Fantastic interpersonal relationships
smascq,t5_2tyg2,A pretty fucked up and neglected childhood
smascq,t5_2tyg2,and addicted to adderall which turned into a meth addiction
smascq,t5_2tyg2,But this guy had absolutely everything together
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Until one day he just snapped
smascq,t5_2tyg2,He used to kiss me awake
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Now when I ask him to shut off the light in the bathroom
smascq,t5_2tyg2,he says I wish I never met you
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Youre sent from hell to destroy me
smascq,t5_2tyg2,  I cant get him out of the house to see anyone because if he addresses any of his issues
smascq,t5_2tyg2,he shuts down and becomes just infinitely more psychotic
smascq,t5_2tyg2,Its ruining many many many peoples lives

sjtqqd,t5_2s23e,Im always kinda nervous because I take copaxone because I am on big gun immunosuppressants for another issue and I feel so stable and healthy
sjtqqd,t5_2s23e,But if my MRI changes I have to be taken off all meds and started on a stronger MS med and hope it treats the other issue
sjtqqd,t5_2s23e,I will sleep easy for another night
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Dumbest thing I ever got psychosis from Tldr at the bottom
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,So I have bipolar one with psychosis
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,This means I have to be careful with various substances I consume
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,moreso than most with non-bipolar psychosis
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,because any number of things can trigger hypomania
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,which I have about a day and a half to identify as such before it escalates into Mania  psychosis
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,while I can take stimulant medication for my ADHD fine
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,if I have  cups of coffee in one day I absolutely cannot have any coffee for the next day or so
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,ill go hypo and them manic
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,bodies are weird
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,But my absolute biggest trigger is antidepressants
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Every single antidepressant Ive ever triedProzac
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,every single onehas trigged mania
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Usually within - days of starting it
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,regardless of other meds Im on
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Prozac made me manic and unable to sleep while I was on Seroquel for fucks sake
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Thats how sensitive to them I am
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,So one christmas
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I was gifted some lotion
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,and because I have excessively dry hands and also crochet
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I was thrilled
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I immediately put some on
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,and did again before bed
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,The next morning
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I woke up at am on the dot
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,but sometimes that just happens
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Ill keep an eye on it
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2, I got up
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I put the lotion on
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Suddenly I have a flurry of ideas for my art
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I ask my husband if I seem manic
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,he says Im talking fast and fidgeting more than usual
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Guess Im probably hypomanic
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,But hypomania doesnt always progress into Mania for me
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,sometimes when I have natural non-triggered episodes
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,its a  shot
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,and I have a longer ramp-up timegenerally around - days
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,So I decide to just write down the start date if the episode and some symptoms so I remember to tell my psychiatrist at our next appointment
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Then I go about my day
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,slightly more impulsive and talkative than usual
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,and before bed I apply the lotion again
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Its doing wonders for me hands
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,and Im excited
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,But when I lay down
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,shit hits the fan
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,My kind is going faster than I can comprehend
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I have a burning desire to go for a run I am physically disabled
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,this is near-impossible for me
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I start planning two novels
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,a poetry collection
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,and three blankets in my head
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I ask my husband if he exists
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,He tells me to call my psychiatrist tomorrow and try to sleep
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I roll around in bed before deciding fuck it
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2, and getting up
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Its three in the morning
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I decide to download over  sims  mods and boot up the game
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I call my psychiatrist
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,even though it is not even dawn
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Im suddenly having a bad
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,fast episode for no reason
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I think I need emergency meds
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Nothing is real
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2, I hang up
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,then turn to grab the lotion on my desk
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,and I see it has St
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Johns Wort in it
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Which is an antidepressant
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I spend the next several hours frantically googling and playing Sims
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,because attention has never been my strong suit
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,especially not while Manic As Fuck
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,At am my psych calls me and asks whats going on
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Can St Johns Wort absorb through the skin
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2, I ask him
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Can it absorb through the skin
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2, Theres a pause
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I realize he has not context so I continue
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I was trying to figure out why I was suddenly horribly manic
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I was gifted some lotion recently with St Johns Wort and didnt realize
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Do you think it could absulorb through the skin and make me manic like every other antidepressant
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,dont see why not
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,I hear papers shuffling
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,You sound Manic for sure
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Should I send in some Seroquel
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Just enough to get you out of this episode
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,   That would be great
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,See you next week
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,  Tldr got a new lotion
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Used it for several days
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,became Very Manic very fast
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Turns out it had St Johns Wort
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,which can absorb through the skin
sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,Now my psychiatrist warns all antidepressant-sensitive bipolar patients to double check their lotions
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,reliable tests for lupus
qm11tj,t5_2rtve, What tests have the most precise specificity and sensitivity for lupus andor anything else that would be causing my lupus symptoms
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,   My Rheumatology referral was denied because my positive ANA and positive not equivocal anti-ds-dna were not high enough
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,  I have - symptoms on the list
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,My anti-dsdna test was borderline a few years ago
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,and the most recent test numbers put me into the positive rangenot sky-high
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,but definitely positive
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,I have clear symptoms
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,so something is going on
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,Even if I have just a mild case of lupus or early-stage
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,I would like to know whats going on
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,since lupus can progress
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,and my increasing symptoms over the last years correlate to my slowly increasing anti-dsdna
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,Rheum requested more detailed testing before my PCP sends me back
qm11tj,t5_2rtve, What are more the more specific blood tests can I get
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,What blood tests should I ask my PCP for
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,Not general inflammatory markers like CRP
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,She already did those and they were negative
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,My CRP tends to fluctuate
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,   Im feeling a certain sense of apathydoubt from my doctor
qm11tj,t5_2rtve,IF only someone would take charge

sdjnvj,t5_2s23e,Im thinking about moving away from New Zealand when Covid settles down a bit

rjd06d,t5_2syer,Have you ever had Gout in the metatarsal Little background I got diagnosed with Gout about - years ago
rjd06d,t5_2syer,I went on allo
rjd06d,t5_2syer,and after a year I lost about  lbs
rjd06d,t5_2syer,Then I stopped taking allo and didnt have Gout but maybe once ever year or so
rjd06d,t5_2syer,But maybe  months ago I thought I had a stress fracture in my metatarsal
rjd06d,t5_2syer,went to the Dr and he said he didnt see anything on xray so he thought it may be a stress reaction
rjd06d,t5_2syer,I take some time off volleyball and it goes away
rjd06d,t5_2syer,Now I am back in the gym and that same feeling is back but now it feels like it moved over two metatarsals
rjd06d,t5_2syer,It has been noticeable for like ish weeks
rjd06d,t5_2syer,but not as debilitating as Gout when I get it in the big toe
rjd06d,t5_2syer,Has anyone heardhad Gout in a metatarsal
rjd06d,t5_2syer,Is that possible
rjd06d,t5_2syer,Maybe I am just getting old and starting to fall apart one metatarsal at a time
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,Can Anyone Suggest What May Be Happening
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,Im a F and formally diagnosed with epilespy at age  however my parents and myself believe I had seizures before due to certain things time slowing down
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,hearing voices of teachersfriends at night
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,waking up screaming and running to my parents
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,vomiting on my sister we shared a bed and not knowing who my mom was
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,All of these things happened from six months-ten thirteen of age
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,Back to the point  I was diagnosed because I had a  tonic-clonic seizure at school
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I had another the following week
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,Another another a month later I woke
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,got really tight and had one
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I then had another two a year later
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,And three more in my s during one I was found crying
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,in another I broke a closet door and a huge bruise on my leg
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,and in the last one I came stumbling out of my bedroom my mom thought I was havinghad had a stroke
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,The last one was in my late s
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I had been on meds that whole time
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,During the last one I was brought to the ER and given something to calm down
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,In  ag 
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I believe I had a seizure
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,but Im unsure while at work
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,a seemed to go away strazing into distance I only came back when a student called out my name
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I was put on more meds
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I had a seizure in which I cried
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,and kept talking about weird things people were going tokilling me
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,people coming for mehallucations
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I was brought to the ER and given a shot to calm me down
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I took a week off of work
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I was put on different meds
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,In the late springmid-summer of

rzibes,t5_2s1h9, however it lasted much longer  minutes
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,so I was brought to the ER
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I had several smaller seizures that were similar over the course of  hours
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,The ER could tell me nothing and gave me a shot to calm me down
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,Before this one
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I felt off tingling in my legs
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,an odd feeling around me
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I began having seizures again
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,the same as above at  am and had them on and off until  pm-ish
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I was brought to another ER
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I do have lesions on the brain from a stroke I had at birth leading to CP
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,so after a CT which they thought was weird
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,they did an MRI
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,They came back clean
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I was having the larger seizures during both
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I then spent all of November and most December I had - seizures a day
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I had seizures as I had in -November st of 
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,On November fifth
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I began to have smaller seizures were I laughed and had a small tick in which Id click my tongue and then make noises like Whoa or talk to myself in a weird voice
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,Sometimes Id laugh
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,click my tongue and then jerk my head to the left side
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,The left sde is were I had my stroke
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I also kept having the larger seizures once to twice a week
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I was absent from my job all of December and most of November I kept trying to go back to work
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I was seizure free from the th to the th
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I had a larger seizure same as above once and then two more large ones in the early afternoon Jan rd
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I went back to work on Jan rd thinkfully my students werent there
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,as they have already witnessed two
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I dont know if this will be important
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,but sometimes after the larger ones
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I become child like and want people to stay with me
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I  would seek out my parents
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,whom I stayed with from November nd until December th
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I have seen three neurologist in the past two months
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,My regular one quickly suggest a surgery
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,The next one did an EEG
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,and despite me having small laughing seizures
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,he stated it came back with no seizure actvity
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,The third suggested that I may be having two or three seizures at once and in different parts of the brain
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,or that I may be having a seizure which is setting something else off
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,or that I may not be having seizures at all
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,but that something else is happening
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,due to the fact that my jerking and rocking dont look like seizure normal seizure movement
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I do have CP
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,so that may be why the movements are off
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,This doctor was the best Id seen
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,he stated that he didnt feel comfortable ordering tests
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,as hes not an expert or my regular neurolgist
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,but he sent his thoughts along to my regular doctor
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,If you got this far
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,can anyone give a guess or advide on what is happening
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,Im a bit scared that there may be a major issue
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,The epilespy speacilists in my state are all booked until April
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I have another appointment with my regular doctor on Monday
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,I have thought about taking a  sick leave from work
rzibes,t5_2s1h9,though I doctor would have to suggest it

sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,Guys I need some help
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,So about a year ago I had a psychotic episode and had audio hallucinations
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,During this episode I thought it would be a good idea to stop the insanity by slitting my wrists
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,The blood clotted and I saw the sunrise the next morning
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,But recently I had another episode
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,It started off with chanting
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,you have the mark of the beast  you
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,have the mark
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,of the beeeeaaaast
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,My mental health has since fallen off the rails I cant stop thinking about what they said and the message they were trying to convey to me
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,It seems as though I was tricked into cutting myself by these voices
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,Is the mark of the beast the mark you give yourself when you scar your wrists
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,The image attached to this link is a statue of satan
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,If you look at the wrist you can clearly see a self inflicted scar wound of a slit wrist
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,glxNvcNQDCnsey   Where these voices right
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,Is the mark of the beast created of your own doing
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,Is the mark of the beast a mark of your betrayal of gods creation
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,I cant stop thinking about this theory that I have
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,If anyone could help with their thoughts on this matter it would be greatly appreciated
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,Any information on what the mark actually is or anyone with a religious background please help
sdekh9,t5_2tyg2,Thanks guys love you
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,How do I believe harder
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,Ive had all the tests including motility
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,tried more diets and treatments than I can count
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,including stuff like hypnosis and neuromodulation
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,Im stuck on elemental diet and daily laxatives and I almost never leave the house
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,Im  sure Im not crazy
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,there certainly is no link between my feelings and symptoms
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,But at this point I have to wonder if maybe I am just a nutjob and need to believe harder
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,Maybe I didnt completely truly  believe in the treatments and if I just tried harder to think myself well they wouldve worked
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,Especially sitting here feeling like crap from the booster when we now know adverse reactions are just a nocebo effect
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,My brain is making this bullshit up and I cant make it stop
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,So theres every chance my whole shitty life is my brains fault
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,I know about cbt
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,like I said Ive tried hypnosis
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,I wouldve thought if i was nuts they wouldve worked but who knows
sy4yr9,t5_2s3g1,TLDR how can I believe harder in treatments and think my ibs away

p3t0un,t5_2syer,Supplements Im looking into getting celery seed and tart cherry pills as it seems these may have moderate benefits in preventing or shortening the duration of flare ups
p3t0un,t5_2syer,I know they wont be nearly as effective as medicine such as alopurinol
p3t0un,t5_2syer,but I currently dont have insurance and want to minimize the chances of me having a flare up until I do get insurance
p3t0un,t5_2syer,Does any one have any recommendations for these two products
p3t0un,t5_2syer,for celery seeds
p3t0un,t5_2syer,Im looking at Amazon and see there is celery seeds
p3t0un,t5_2syer,celery seed extract
p3t0un,t5_2syer,and even the celery seed extract that has a version called  nb that I saw someone here recommend
p3t0un,t5_2syer,Similarly with tart cherry pills
p3t0un,t5_2syer,there is tart cherry extract
p3t0un,t5_2syer,tart cherry concentrate
p3t0un,t5_2syer,and other versions
p3t0un,t5_2syer,So I just want to make sure I get the most beneficial versions of these products and dont mind spending more to do so

oy1o8x,t5_2syer,Uric acid test strips may not last as long as you think Ive had my UASure meter since early December
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,and I keep the box of test strips that came with it in the door of the fridge per their instructions
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,and let the strip come up to temperature before using it
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,Id been getting low readings pretty reliably that matched my lab work 
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,Since it was pretty solid for a while and not changing
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,I didnt test for a few months
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,Recently I tested and got a 
oy1o8x,t5_2syer, which was a bit alarming
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,and I tested again a couple weeks later and got a 
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,Not to say those are bad levels to have
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,but Ive tended to do better in the low s
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,I got some lab work done the other day and my levels are in fact still holding steady around 
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,All I can figure here is that the test strips dont have the longevity theyre believed to
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,Theyre supposed to last a year if stored properly
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,but that might not be the case
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,If youre testing at home
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,you might want to consider replacing the strips after  months
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,Ill do some more tests anyway in the coming weeks to be sure
oy1o8x,t5_2syer,but I think this is something worth keeping an eye on for anyone who does the home testing

stvz18,t5_2syer,DiscussionOpinion Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia   Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia Hints for Better Lifestylehttpswww
stvz18,t5_2syer,govpmcarticlesPMC  Folks its articles like this that I think cause a lot of confusion on gout
stvz18,t5_2syer,People come here looking for ways to avoid being on life long medication or how to mitigate pain or how to stop a flare
stvz18,t5_2syer,This article points to a lot of the things people try to control gout flares that arent drugs
stvz18,t5_2syer,Please understand control of uric acid levels when talking about gout means keeping your UA levels lower than mgdL  if you have tophi and keeping it there
stvz18,t5_2syer,Everything else is trying to stop gout flaring your immune system response to monosodium urate crystals
stvz18,t5_2syer,Why does the gout attack stop
stvz18,t5_2syer,A roadmap for the immune pathogenesis of gouthttpsrmdopen
stvz18,t5_2syer,comcontentSupple  In reality you have probably been hyperuricemic for quite some time years as uric acid isnt usually tested unless there is an issue
stvz18,t5_2syer,Monosodium urate crystals have been building up in your joints
stvz18,t5_2syer,Then one day you stub your toe or eat that trigger food that causes inflammation and you have a gout flare
stvz18,t5_2syer,You take anti-inflammatoriesNASID andor immunosuppressantscolchicine to stop your immune system response
stvz18,t5_2syer,At some point the immune system may stop and the crystals get sheathed until you stub your toe again or eat that foot that causes inflammation
stvz18,t5_2syer,The gout flares ebb and flow with your immune system response not with crystals coming and going
stvz18,t5_2syer,When you go onto a Urate lowering therapy it could be months to years before all the crystals dissolve even though your uric acid is held low
stvz18,t5_2syer, months after I had my UA levels at 
stvz18,t5_2syer,mgdL I still flared which means that there were still MSU crystals present
stvz18,t5_2syer,Controlling serum uric acid levels needs to be a constant low with a threat of flaring anyway as the crystals dissolve and the sheaths get disturbed
stvz18,t5_2syer,Eating your way to a low enough serum acid level is difficult in my experience
stvz18,t5_2syer,FTA Nonpharmacological Management emphasis is mine  Since uric acid is an end-product of purine metabolism in humans
stvz18,t5_2syer,it is reasonable to suggest that excessive ingestion of purine-rich foods causes an increase in serum uric acid
stvz18,t5_2syer,ingestion of RNA corresponding to  mg purinekg of body weight increased plasma uric acid by 
stvz18,t5_2syer, indicating that excessive consumption of purine increases plasma uric acid concentration
stvz18,t5_2syer,not all purine-containing foods have the same effect on serum uric acid level and gout risk
stvz18,t5_2syer,  A purine-rich diet for  to  weeks produces only a small transient rise in serum uric acid level of  to  mgdL
stvz18,t5_2syer,while an isocaloric low-purine diet for  to  days will slightly reduce serum uric acid by about  to  mgdL
stvz18,t5_2syer,govpmcarticlesPMC- suggesting that strict restriction of consumption of purine is not practical or effective for uric acid control
stvz18,t5_2syer,adequate calorie intake and weight management with moderation of meat and seafood in the diet has been recently recommended for gouthyperuricemia subjects
stvz18,t5_2syer,This has been my experience
stvz18,t5_2syer,On the extreme end on a ketolow carb high fat diet LCHF I have lost a lot of weight lbs down now and have dropped my serum acid levels from 
stvz18,t5_2syer,In addition I eat a lot of high purine foods red meat
stvz18,t5_2syer,I am just one person but I am adding my anecdotal evidence that it isnt purine ingestion that causes serum acid levels to rise
stvz18,t5_2syer,My best guess is the reduction of sugar is the reason for my decrease in serum acid levels from some of the other articles I have read
stvz18,t5_2syer,Serum Uric Acid
stvz18,t5_2syer,and Cardiometabolic Disorders A Critical Reviewhttpswww
stvz18,t5_2syer,govpmcarticlesPMC  TLDR My take Gouty Arthritis is curable by lowering your UA levels low enough for MSU crystals to dissolve
stvz18,t5_2syer,Hyperuricemia is manageable through daily ULT medication
stvz18,t5_2syer,Eating and supplementation typically only addresses flaring Gouty Arthritis not Hyperuricimea UA levels  
stvz18,t5_2syer,mgdL  TLDR Do everything you can to lose weight

sx97h8,t5_2saq9,How to get my doctor to take me seriously
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,This is a bit long
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,With a complicated medical history
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I am afraid my doctor is either out of her depth or thinks I am a hypochondriac
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Im worried about her taking me seriously when it comes to being evaluated for POTS
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I dont know how to approach the question
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,First let me say that I had a serious case of Lyme disease that left me on social security disability for  years
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I finally got back into the work force in 
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Since then I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I dont know if thats because my doctors were more comfortable coming up with a treatment plan for fibro than the chronic effects of Lyme
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,or if the fibro is a catch-all diagnosis
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,or if I actually have fibro
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Lifestyle changes and medication for fibro have certainly improved my quality of life
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,but I have never stopped feeling like there is something else going on
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,For years now
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I have been getting bouts of lightheadedness
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,and coming close to passing out when I stand up
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,To the point where the room closes in and I have to grab on to whatever is closest
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I have never actually passed out
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,but come right to the edge
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I also struggle with terrible fatigue
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,and feeling disoriented
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I know these symptoms over lap with fibromyalgia and Lyme
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,About  years ago I was having more and more GI issuesespecially nausea but also indigestion
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,and lots of noises from my stomach other than gas
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,So I saw a specialist who after many tests diagnosed me with GERD
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I felt it was more than just that
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,being exhausted with the medical system I gave up
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Symptoms have not gone away
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Then I started to get purple feet when sitting
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I had some tests but was ultimately told it was poor circulation from sitting on a hard chair
sx97h8,t5_2saq9, years ago  I was having chest pain and feeling thirsty all the timedrinking over a gallon of water a day and still thirsty
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I was also being woken up in the middle of the night by chest pain
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I had some blood tests
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I had a heart monitor for a week and no findings
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I chose to go off my adderall that I take for ADHD even though I had never experienced cardiac symptoms from it before
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,There was an improvement of symptoms but they didnt go away completely
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Then my brain fog got incredibly bad and I was feeling so lightheaded that I would sometimes be disoriented which could be very scary especially if I was driving
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I realized it was often very bad after a meal
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,I tried to get help from my PCP
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,but she said these things are very hard to diagnose and suggested I needed to go back on my adderall
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,So I did and it helped to an extent
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,recently I have seen my toes turn blue and legs become mottled blue and red in the shower shockingly so
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Looking like I got beat up
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Knowing how none of my concerns over the last few years were resolved and how I felt rather brushed off
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Ive tried to ignore it
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Ive tried not to look it up online and get pulled down the rabbit hole
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,but it kept eating at me like what if this is the clue I need
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,So I did and thats how I came to POTS
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,So I did a test at home and tested my heart rate after lying down for  mins
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Then stood up and tested it again every  minutes for  minutes
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,This is the result    bpm lying down   bpm after  minutes standing  bpm after  minutes standing   bpm after  minutes standing   bpm after  minutes standing   bpm after  minutes standing   I feel very strongly this all adds up to POTS
sx97h8,t5_2saq9,Can you please give me some advice on how to approach the situation to be taken seriously and not looked at like Ive self diagnosed
sq1rib,t5_2tyg2,Are the voices intelligent
sq1rib,t5_2tyg2,by the way

sq1rib,t5_2tyg2,Im doing a LOT better

skp7o9,t5_2saq9,I have a close friend who also has POTS and she got COVID approximately a month ago
skp7o9,t5_2saq9,and ever since recovering it appears her POTS has gone into remission
skp7o9,t5_2saq9,She is not the first person I have heard this happening to post-virus recovery
skp7o9,t5_2saq9,Just as viruses can trigger POTS
skp7o9,t5_2saq9,it is appearing that post-virus illness also has the ability to allow it to go into a remission state
skp7o9,t5_2saq9,I found this very interesting and wondered 
skp7o9,t5_2saq9, Does anyone have personal experience with this
skp7o9,t5_2saq9, Do you know anyone with a similar experience
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,waiting for the other shoe to drop I am not really even sure what I am trying to ask right now

rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I have had one flair up

rzhogd,t5_2s23e,My last MRI in October showed some new lesions while others have gotten smaller
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,but my neurologist assumes the new lesions are from my flair up before starting my DMT
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I know MS affects everyone different
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,but I have honestly not had any long lasting symptoms
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I feel normal despite having lesions in my brain and spinal cord
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I am not sure if my MS was caught early or a tidal wave of awful will hit me at any moment
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I just feel like things should be worse
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I know I should feel thankfu and I aml that I dont feel any different physically since my diagnosis
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,but I feel like it is too good to be true
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,Is this the norm
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,Are things fine and then just awful all of a sudden
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,Or does it happen so slowly
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,My way to cope is to try and controlplan things
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,and with MS I just cant
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I want an answer of what this will look like for me moving forward
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,but I know it is impossible
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,The unknown terrifies me
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,as I know it does for us all
rzhogd,t5_2s23e,I am just struggling and know this is my sign to go talk to a therapist which I did at the beginning

sqax07,t5_2r876,However my lungs are not doing so well right now so my doctor suggested I should think about starting trikafta anyway
sqax07,t5_2r876,This is a very hard decision for me to make cause I really do not want to lose my kidney
sqax07,t5_2r876,My liver is also kind of fibrotic so Im just scared it will only worsen my symptoms
sqax07,t5_2r876,Any experiences here

rph3yk,t5_2rtve,Tumid lupus and hydroxychloroquine interested in your experience Hi
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,I have recently been diagnosed with skin lupus
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,My dermatologist says it looks unusual and didnt know for sure what type it is i
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,doesnt look like discoid or some other more common types and I have had a small rash of it before and it healed without scarring after some months
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,My bloods are all normal and lupus band test is negative on biopsy but pathologist says it looks like lupus
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,I have checked out online photos and to me it absolutely looks like tumid lupus along with some other features of the pathology which fit this diagnosis
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,I am currently trying topical steroids to see if they are enough along with vitamin d and fish oil but I think I will need to try hydroxychloroquine soon which is what my dermatologist is suggesting next
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,For those with this condition on plaquinil
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,do you take it all the time or just in summer or when you get a rash etc
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,Will it clear an existing rash
rph3yk,t5_2rtve,Have you had any luck just managing it topically
sfd0q3,t5_2tyg2,I feel disgusted when people make fun of people with psychosis that takes into effect
sfd0q3,t5_2tyg2,I just hate when those make fun of people with psychosis that takes into effect
sfd0q3,t5_2tyg2,I just want to swear
sfd0q3,t5_2tyg2,and say bad words
sfd0q3,t5_2tyg2,I feel so much anger against bullies that make fun of us
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,Did a neurologist or MS specialist diagnose you
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,So Ive posted here a few times now
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,and the last  years now Ive been in and out of the hospital
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,I have been extremely sick since I was a kid
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,But it blew over the edge two years ago
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,My legs gave out from under me
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,my vision stopped being mine
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,almost like somebody possessed my eyes
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,and I became extremely dizzy and sick
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,Ive had a lot of symptoms of MS and so then did a MRI on my brain
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,I have  lesions and an recently they said they found another abnormality is what they are calling it
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,Thats all hes told me
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,there was no further explanation
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,I had a spinal tap back in September but my results havent came back yet somehow
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,There is a written report on the lesions on my brain explaining that I am a candidate for MS
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,did you guys did get a diagnosis from an MS Specialist or a neurologist
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,Im just feeling so uncertain with this all
s86hvt,t5_2s23e,I feel like I should see a specialist who knows this disease better than anyone else but my doctor doesnt say I qualify to see one till Im able to be diagnosed with MS
skr1ps,t5_2syer,looking for general advice I had a gout attack in the last few weeks
skr1ps,t5_2syer,my first one
skr1ps,t5_2syer,and my GP hasnt been overly helpful
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Attack didnt seem like a typical gout flare up
skr1ps,t5_2syer,pain was severe in my left big toe but swelling wasnt really noticeable at all
skr1ps,t5_2syer,the area was slightly red
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Been on a mostly plant based diet except for low fat milk in my tea and coffee
skr1ps,t5_2syer,I had been drinking alcohol at Christmas but havent had any since new years Day
skr1ps,t5_2syer,attack was mid January
skr1ps,t5_2syer,I dont drink alcohol often
skr1ps,t5_2syer,when I do its probably  whether I only have one or two Vs probably drinking too much
skr1ps,t5_2syer,but itd be common for me to go a few months without touching a drop
skr1ps,t5_2syer,I really only socially drink alcohol but I do love it when I get to
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Doc just did a blood test and I got a call from his receptionist saying test confirmed gout
skr1ps,t5_2syer,I asked if there was a follow up or if the blood test screened out possibilities like diabetes or kidney disease
skr1ps,t5_2syer,she just said that the drs note was that the test confirmed gout and advice was to just watch my diet
skr1ps,t5_2syer,As far as I can tell my diet for the last few months doesnt have any obvious triggers for gout except maybe for the alcohol at Christmas
skr1ps,t5_2syer,turn  this year
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Im overweight height  and weight  stone
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Im seeing a lot of different things online
skr1ps,t5_2syer,some pretty scary stuff about how linked gout is with more serious conditions like heart disease
skr1ps,t5_2syer,diabetes would the blood test have screened for those or did he probably just check for uric acid levels
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Do I need to get screened for those after getting a gout diagnosis
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Im going to try and get a different doctor to talk over all this as well and book in with a dietician but any advice or input would be appreciated
skr1ps,t5_2syer,going a bit crazy with all the gout doom and gloom Im seeing online
skr1ps,t5_2syer,When I go out for drinks I love a few beers
skr1ps,t5_2syer,are they completely off the menu for me now or are there any low purine beers that a few wont cause too much of an issue
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Is everyone different with regards to what triggers them
skr1ps,t5_2syer,Fretting over the alcohol seems odd I know but Im getting married this year and now worried about drinking on my stag do and wedding day leading to a world of pain again
pwkdws,t5_2syer,Gout in pinky knuckle Well I guess Im following my fathers footsteps
pwkdws,t5_2syer,Before he passed at  his knuckles looked like golf balls from untreated gout
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I have been prone to flare ups in both my right and left big toes since my early s
pwkdws,t5_2syer,Now in my mid s
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I have just had my first flare up in my right hand pinky knuckle
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I got to say its just as painful as getting it in the toe
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I dont know why every doctor I go to either prescribes me colchicine
pwkdws,t5_2syer,prednisone or indomethacin
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I would think with a flare up - times a year they would start me on a maintenance drug
pwkdws,t5_2syer,especially with the family history
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I thought it might be a staff infection since Ive never had a flare up in my hand
pwkdws,t5_2syer,So Im sitting at urgent care waiting to see what they say
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I was sick all last week with the flu and I think that is what triggered it
pwkdws,t5_2syer,I hadnt had any alcohol and was avoiding eating heavy as well as red meat
pwkdws,t5_2syer,It could have been a mix of a little dehydration and weakened immune system
pwkdws,t5_2syer,Has anyone else experienced a flare up after being sick with a bug
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,A few questions about marijuana and epilepsy
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,Im well aware marijuana cant outright replace your existing medication and I dont plan on doing that at all
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,I have medicine that works for me and I plan on keeping to that
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,but I do just have a few questions
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,In mid-January I am going to be completely out of my medicine and wont be able to get it back until sometime in February
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,possibly mid-February even
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,Luckily though my previous doctor is putting me on a different
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,cheaper medicine just so I am on something to hopefully help
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,My question is this
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,I already know that the medicine hes temporarily switching me to does not work because Ive been on it before
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,So would using marijuana
rihu24,t5_2s1h9,be in a tincture or even a gummy possibly be a good idea to also hopefully help keep my seizures away
shqmbi,t5_2tyg2,Does anyone here know the Muffin Man
s1080x,t5_2s23e,tested positive and scared That is all
qzct5z,t5_2r876,So Ive had CF since I was  years old
qzct5z,t5_2r876,Im now 
qzct5z,t5_2r876,I still live at home and I just feel like sometimes my family doesnt understand what Im going through
qzct5z,t5_2r876,Ive been struggling in school and Ive tried to explain to my parents that its hard having to stay on top of my treatments and stay on top of my school work but they tell me to no use my disease as an excuse for my laziness and inability to apply myself
qzct5z,t5_2r876,Idk I just feel so alone sometimes
qzct5z,t5_2r876,I cant tell them anything and its hard to keep these feelings bottled up
qzct5z,t5_2r876,Growing up my family admired me because of how well I was handling everything despite having CF and I just felt this pressure to constantly act like nothing bothers me and now at 
qzct5z,t5_2r876,I finally feel ready to tell my parents how I feel
qzct5z,t5_2r876,how having CF makes me feel and how some mornings I dont want to get up because I dread having to do my treatments
qzct5z,t5_2r876,How having CF makes me anxious and depressed and yet my parents keep telling me that Im just lazy and that if I went to bed earlier I wouldnt feel so anxious or depressed
qzct5z,t5_2r876,Im not asking for a free pass on life
qzct5z,t5_2r876,I just need a bit of compassion and sympathy uk
qzct5z,t5_2r876,It just really hurts my feelings
qzct5z,t5_2r876,Just because I have my CF under control doesnt mean I dont struggle to live with it
qzct5z,t5_2r876,I kinda just needed to vent to people who might understand what Im going through
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,POTS flare causing fog of depression
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,Does anyone experience this
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,Last week its like a fog of depression settled over me and is taking its time to clear
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,Theres no reason Im cognitively aware of for its presence
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,Maybe its just a normal human experience
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,but Im trying to think if maybe its related a POTS flare
sx77sn,t5_2saq9, Ive got mild POTS
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,but have noticed my heart rate has been way higher after eating these past few weeks versus my normal which is still high after eating
sx77sn,t5_2saq9,I also have celiac disease and menorrhagia so who knows
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,Had a breakthrough seizure and I dont know what to tell people I stream on Twitch every day and I try to use my channel as a way to educate people about epilepsy and remove the stigma
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,My seizures usually arent non violent
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,but I forgot my medicine today and had a pretty bad one
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,I dont know exactly what happened bit Im achy
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,my nose is very bloody a cut on the outside
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,and my knee is bruised
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,I talk about epilepsy a lot and the effects of the stigma
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,but Im worried people seeing me bruised up might be too much
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,At the same time I dont want to hide it
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,as I feel like that would be disingenuous to my message
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,Ive only got a few hours to decide before my next stream which Ill probably cancel
rzpavu,t5_2s1h9,but I hoped typing this out could help me a little I think it has and Id appreciate some support
ss12f5,t5_2tyg2,Im really starting to get scared to work
ss12f5,t5_2tyg2,I work at a restaurant and its ben a couple of weeks where its ben awful
ss12f5,t5_2tyg2,The restaurant is really small so I can hear peoples conversation without not even doing it on purpose
ss12f5,t5_2tyg2,The thing that scares me is when I hear people yelling
ss12f5,t5_2tyg2,or a group of people talking but there is no one in the restaurant
ss12f5,t5_2tyg2,Its frustrating because then Im con constant fear about not knowing what is real and what is not
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,Important Question Has anyone had to leave an abusive volatile situation bc it made you so sick with your POTS this includes a very abusive ex partner and my  children that he refuses to let me take with me but right now while Im feeling this way I dont know if I can handle it on my own with working full time etc note that I am the sole financial provider for all  of the children since theyve been born
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,I guess my question is how do you cope with it bc Im feeling lots of guilt bc of my children but I know I absolutely had to do it for my health and if Im not healthy how can I ever take care of them
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,Their dad has been constantly battling me since he says that I walked out and last night we had a very heated phone convo and I was so so sick afterwards face bright red chest tight hard to breathe heart racing all night by the grace of God I did sleep
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,This made me realize how imperative it was for me to leave the situation mind you I left my beautiful home practically all of my belongings
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,Can anyone share if theyve had to do something similar and it has helped with your illness and help me get over the guilt bc I never ever put myself first
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,I love my children to death but as I said if Im not healthy how can I be there for them in the long run
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,Even when I was in the home I would work force myself to get there then by the time I got home it was straight to my bed w symptoms and knowing I was in the home with him made me feel horrible
sjjpo1,t5_2saq9,I got this condition I can almost guarantee bc of this abuse just why do I feel so guilty about taking care of myself
suvzhg,t5_2tyg2,whats the worst theyve done to you and tried to cover up in a bedlam
suvzhg,t5_2tyg2,I remember quite a few unhealthy practises done on me but when i spoke out their lawyer said that i was on drugs
suvzhg,t5_2tyg2,has anything like that happened to you
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,Burping Throughout the Day Hey Everyone
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,Hope you all are doing well
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,Ive started burping NON-STOP
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,I burp after I wake up
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,after I drink water
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,and after I eat throughout the ENTIRE day
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,This has been going on for about a month and Im not sure how to differentiate symptoms of GERD or just Aerophagia
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,I started on CPAP for sleep apnea treatment  weeks ago
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,Most cases of CPAP aerophagia have people only burp after they wake up
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,which is why Im concerned
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,Also had a case of heartburn last week  Do you guys think the burping is indicative of GERD
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,How can I tell the diff vs Aerophagia
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,TLDR Started CPAP a month ago but am burping non stop throughout the entire day
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,How can you differentiate between aerophagia and GERD symptoms
rskm78,t5_2qlaa,Should I see a GI
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I feel worthless and like the universe is laughing at me
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,When someone cares
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I push them away or hurt them
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,how do I make my life valuable
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,sorry for the long post I am  yo been through a bunch of BS in life
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I wont go into the back stories as they will be way too long
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,Im sure a lot of people know how I feel and maybe someone can offer some words of wisdom
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,advice or anything really
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,at this point in life it seems like I will never be happy again and have no purpose
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I am in a constant state of brain fog and frustration
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,it used to be sadness and just pain but its turning into bitterness and confusion
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I have lost all friends of mine and my family doesnt even want to be around me
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,Also recently lost a close family member
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I used to take antidepressants and antianxiety meds and I stopped and was very frightened by the withdrawal and side effects
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,horrible visual and auditory hallucinations among other things accompanying mental breakdowns
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,After this I have not been the same and wish I had never started taking them
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,its been almost a year now since I stopped but still see side effects every day
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,when its bad I think people want to kill me
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,hurt me or are plotting against me
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I make connections to things on the TV or radio that might not be there constantly which makes me even more afraid
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,the only person I really have in my life at this point is my boyfriend and I am slowly losing him too
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,It doesnt help that I constantly have feelings of impending doom and thinking he is against me or lying about things
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,so I lash out
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I am afraid because I feel stuck in this now and I have nowhere to leave to
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I have  cats which are the only beings before him that have been there when I was very alone and going through withdrawal and I dont want to lose them
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,Though I feel like Im going to be homeless so Im terrified
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,if I do end up homeless I literally lose everything I have
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,and risk death and more mental breakdowns
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I am exhausted of feeling angry and sad but cant seem to feel happy ever
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,And I cant get a job because i kept having breakdowns at work
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I dont know what to do and am stuck now
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I feel like it will never end
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I used to be so ambitious and ready to try new things
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,Artistic and love to write but now cant even imagine like I used to
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,cant even hold an image in my head and can barely breathe sometimes
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,I feel useless and like I only annoy everyone around me
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,Im just a burden and I dont know what to do anymore
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,if anyone has information about shelters or places that might accept animals too please message me or comment
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,thank you for taking your time to read this
smhc7v,t5_2tyg2,all the time I think is this really all that life is going to be for me

sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,How do you tell if you were bullied or if it is a delusion
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I have a kinda ambivalent relationship with some people from my High school
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,Im not meeting any of them
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,Someday I am totally indifferent towards them
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,But right now
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I am imagining things very vividly right now
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I have vivid imagery and I am arguing with them right now
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,Now they are quiet as I write this at least  I can hear their voices inside my head
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,They are malicious right now
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I feel like they try to turn my alliesfriends against me and they try to make me look weak or silly in front of my classmates from a university that I no longer even attend
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I feel sick to my stomach right now
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I feel like something bad is going to happen
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I feel the adrenaline
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,am right now in a bad episode or what
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I didnt saw them for seven years
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,Maybe I was really bullied by them
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,But my memory is very vague about that
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I only have the vivid imagery of how they are trying to shove from a cliff which I am  sure didnt happen but I feel like they will try someday if I will trust them enough and then suddenly I see very vividly how they are kicking my corpse
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,Right now I feel like they are going to kill me if they knew I am speaking about them
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,I feel terrible
sgmipe,t5_2tyg2,Sure they were jerks but maybe I remember it all wrong
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,GERD or something more serious
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,Does anyone else have GERD attacks
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,Like where you get intense pain and cold sweats
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,Im freaked out about it being something more serious like heart problems or something
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,The doctor said it was gerd when I saw them last but Im worried and havent had any testing done
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,I scheduled another appointment later this month
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,I havent had symptoms like arm pain or numbness
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,not short of breath
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,but the pain is really intense and is in my upper stomach
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,and some times radiate to my back
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,Its so scary
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,When do you go to the ER
rtynaf,t5_2qlaa,I read that heart problems can cause pain that goes away too so now Im even more worried but I dont wanna run to the ER with covid and get exposed if its just freaking acid reflux
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,Having a job and psychosis open discretion
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,It can really be difficult working while having psychosis
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,In my case when Im at work and hear voices it really makes me anxious
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,The worse part is that I actually work in a restaurant and sometimes I hear people screaming or really loud noises
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,I go outside and all the tables and empty
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,Having a psychotic episode and working it can be so stressful because you need to try to do your best while not being in touch with reality
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,Dealing with coworkersclients can be weird for me because I need to try to do my best to act like Im not loosing it
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,But at the end depends by what job and what state of mind you are
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,  Thank you for reading I wish you the best in your recovery
smi2py,t5_2tyg2,I WANTED WRITE OPEN DISCUSSION AHAHAHAHA
simdye,t5_2s23e,Feeling like a fraud
simdye,t5_2s23e,Okay I feel like this is going to be really hard to explain
simdye,t5_2s23e,I have been diagnosed with RRMS since February  after my initial optic neuritis flair up the previous August
simdye,t5_2s23e,I am currently lying in bed experiencing my first relapse since I was diagnosed
simdye,t5_2s23e,My DMT is ocrevus and Im due my next infusion in a months time
simdye,t5_2s23e,The fatigue is the worst for me
simdye,t5_2s23e,like my muscles dont want to move
simdye,t5_2s23e,BUT my mind being the overthinking machine it is
simdye,t5_2s23e,it keeps telling me stuff like oh you could get up if you wanted to
simdye,t5_2s23e,youre just being lazy
simdye,t5_2s23e,youre a fraud   My own mind is my worst enemy
simdye,t5_2s23e,it is telling me I have imposter syndrome for something I can SEE on an MRI scan
simdye,t5_2s23e,It could be because im missing the activities I do in daily life
simdye,t5_2s23e,like Id usually go to the gym
simdye,t5_2s23e,go for walks etc

se6yas,t5_2tyg2,Mania after antipsychotics wear off
se6yas,t5_2tyg2,Does anyone else experience slight mania after antipsychotics wear off
sh6jrd,t5_2saq9,Does this sound potentially like pots
sh6jrd,t5_2saq9,I am currently going through tests with a cardiologist
sh6jrd,t5_2saq9,but just wanted to see if what I am experiencing is similar to others
sh6jrd,t5_2saq9,Symptoms  Inconsistent chest pain   Fast heart rate  with any type of exertion
sh6jrd,t5_2saq9,even changing posture in my chair  Symptoms worse or feel worse in the morning and gradually get better at night  Short of breath
sh6jrd,t5_2saq9,and fatigue from exertion   Anxiety I think i have more anxiety than the normal person   Obsessed with sensations of the heart   palpations when laughing
sh6jrd,t5_2saq9,or deep exhaling  pounding heart and headaches
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,Im going to start the testing process for MS
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,but I keep disregarding my symptoms
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,Did anyone here do that too and try to ignore everything
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,I have quite a few years of experiences Ive sort of neglected or found other ways to justify the issues
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,I think a lot of it stems from my first neurology visit where the doctor turned to my parents and said this is fake after  seconds of examination
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,The doctor turned to me and told me stop
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,the proceeded to ignore me and tell my parents that I need therapy instead
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,it didnt stop
sajtr5,t5_2s23e, years of psychological therapy and Im certain Im experiencing physical sensations
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,and weakness that is real
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,I went to the ER somewhat recent from a loss mobility
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,and burning pain that lasted for days
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,I returned to work weak and ended up on the chopping block when pandemic lay off started due to less productive work and call outs
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,This is one of my many stories
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,I know I have others and other concerning episodes in my past
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,but something about getting help or admitting I may have this is really scary
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,I watched my dad pretend he didnt have MS after his diagnosis and deteriorate
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,I think im scared
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,Im actually still unemployed and keep telling myself once I find a job ill test then
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,but I think Im going to somehow find the strength to start the process now
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,Has anyone else delayed seeking care due to excuses
sajtr5,t5_2s23e,thinking its all in my head or I can power through it
sqwg73,t5_2s23e,Any dimethyl Fumerate users
sqwg73,t5_2s23e,Has it really helped in delaying the progression of MS

s8vswq,t5_2rtve,Random symptoms Do those here with confirmed lupus get digestive symptoms ever during a flare
s8vswq,t5_2rtve,I was diagnosed in  but Ive never attributed my digestive troubles to lupus and my rheumatologist has never mentioned it
s8vswq,t5_2rtve,Lately Ive been having bad reflux
s8vswq,t5_2rtve,and just pain that comes and goes along with other typical flare symptoms like dizziness
s8vswq,t5_2rtve,Can lupus flares cause stomach issues too
s8vswq,t5_2rtve,This really just sucks
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,Im currently taking 
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,mg in the morning and Ive had a big reduction in a lot of my symptoms
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,like I can actually stand up without having to hold on to something now
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,But Im still having migraines and palpitations among other things
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,I feel like Im so close to being better that its kinda frustrating Im not there yet  My psychiatrist was the one who agreed I probably have POTS and prescribed the Metoprolol but Im seeing a cardiologist next week to get a proper diagnosis
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,He said this obviously isnt his area of speciality
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,so while the medication is doing most of the job
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,Im just wondering what dose of Metoprolol people are on
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,Not really sure how much more I could take or if a different beta blocker would work better if this one isnt doing the full job at this dose
sj7bbb,t5_2saq9,Im just so stressed out about it all lol
sdypob,t5_2tyg2,How long after you stopped Invega Sustenna or switched to Geodon did you notice your weight going down
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,Does anyone know if poor sleep causes flare ups
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,Does poor sleep make POTS symptoms worse
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,Im staying with my in laws for the past  months and I honestly havent had a good night sleep the entire time
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,The bed is awful
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,It hits every single pressure point and hurts my lumbar and its so hot and they snore so loudly
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,So every night Im going to bed at  am  waking up at  because they are so loud in the mornings  I sleep with earplugs all the time too   Usually I need to sleep from pm  am to actually feel rested
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,But anywayI have had continuous POTS flare up since Ive been here
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,Im so lightheaded all the time
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,There isnt a day that I dont have to rest while making breakfast or that I need to immediately sit back down because I blacked  got static vision out when standing up
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,So does anyone know if lack of sleep causes worse symptoms
sp0v5h,t5_2saq9,Or maybe it could be something else going on to cause my flare up

s626cf,t5_2s23e,I recently saw my neurologist and she told me my MS isnt progressed enough to explain my fatigue and also my fatigue-symptoms sound more like CFS and after some googling
s626cf,t5_2s23e,I agree  But afaik

sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,Anything I can do to increase appetite with constipation
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,I got sick last Saturday and diarrhea turned to constipation on Monday
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,I believe I have IBS-C due to ongoing problems with constipation over the last  years
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,so I tend toward constipation  of the time and Im sensitive to sudden bouts
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,I also restarted SSRIs which may have contributed to this
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,I feel much better flu-wise
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,but the constipation is keeping my energy and hopes low
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,Im very fatigued
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,and my appetite is very suppressed

sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,I know the lack of appetite and steady
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,fluctuating nausea is keeping me from eating
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,which Im sure isnt helping due to a lack of fibre and substance to help push this down and out
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,I started forcing myself to drink extra water than usual Im terrible for not drinking and a few glasses of gatorade yesterday but still no movement
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,My last bm was Thursday  days ago but it was very small and took forever to pass
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,just feels like it wont move from my lower gut to my rectum
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,Is there anything I can do to increase my appetite or bypass nausea so I can try to get three substantial meals into me
sw9eyc,t5_2s3g1,Im taking ginger pills once every other day and sipping ginger tea between meals but even that leaves me feeling full

rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,Ive read tons and tons of posts regarding this but I thought Id tell my story and get some information regarding it
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,This all started about a week ago
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,I read something about how Pantoprazole has some long term effects on your body that honestly arent too stellar so I decided to just stop taking it I was taking mg Pantoprazole once a day or twice if needed Anyway

rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,Tons of acid in my throat
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,stomach and chest pain
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,But the worst thing that was happening to me is  was the fluttering in my chest or palpitations possibly
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,Id have a major flair up and the palpitations would continue every  seconds or so for a few minutes
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,Now this made my anxiety INSANE and I was constantly having panic attacks due to it
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,It was a bit of a vicious cycle where symptoms were bad
rlic6x,t5_2qlaa,anxiety was bad and it continued like that for what felt like HOURS

s6tj37,t5_2saq9,I was diagnosed with POTs about two years ago
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,after an extremely stressful situation put way too much strain on my body and caused a serious flare
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,Been learning to live with it slowly
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,and gotten pretty good at knowing my limits and how to manage bad days to keep them from escalating
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,Unfortunately this has also made me unable to work
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,I keep looking for opportunities
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,but Im not consistently abled enough to keep regular hours
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,My body has proven very sensitive to stress and part time online classes are about the most Ive managed to handle
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,I went from pursuing my dream job to now having to question whether Ill ever be able to earn a living wage at all
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,Its a frustrating realization
s6tj37,t5_2saq9,Basically Im having a hard time altering my expectations for myself and accepting what Ive learned are my limits

oq23r1,t5_2syer,Very surprised to find out so many people here have similar stories concerning their gout
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I have had gout flare ups for over ten years
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I would tell my PCP hey my hand
oq23r1,t5_2syer,or foot would hurt off and on randomly
oq23r1,t5_2syer,Then I would be asked Why
oq23r1,t5_2syer, He checked me for RA and that test was negative
oq23r1,t5_2syer,He thought I was just a complainer of sorts and did not take me seriously after that
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I also have kidney disease even thought my AC tests are always between 
oq23r1,t5_2syer,  Last year I had such a bad flare up I went to a ready care because I needed two canes to be able to walk
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I was finally diagnosed with gout at that time
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I was the poster boy for Gout at the ready care that day
oq23r1,t5_2syer,A different PCP at my doctors office treated that flare up then
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I wanted the other doctor to become my new PCP but the office said no
oq23r1,t5_2syer,If my PCP does not diagnose the condition he thinks the other doctors diagnose is wrong
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I am moving on to a different practice in the next few months
oq23r1,t5_2syer,This new doctor specializes in treating gout and diabetes
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I am diabetic also
oq23r1,t5_2syer,I thought my difficulty being correctly diagnosed was just atypical

s6glfy,t5_2s23e,My symptoms always amplify when I dont get enough sleep which is almost always at this point and coffee doesnt seem to alleviate them
s6glfy,t5_2s23e,I can manage the numbness but the dizziness and vision issues are unbearable
s6glfy,t5_2s23e,I also get super stressed which causes brain fog from rapid over thinking because I just hate the feeling of vertigo which just makes it WORSE
s6glfy,t5_2s23e,I got diagnosed last year in May F Im still coming to terms with my diagnosis so these kinds of flair ups are just awful and this constant reminder that Im sick and it will never get better
s6glfy,t5_2s23e,Does anyone have any advice for managing these
p1l5gb,t5_2r876,Hope you cant relate

sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,recovering from psychosis So I had psychosis for Idk maybe  week and a half
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I got stuck twice in delusions
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,and I had this telepathic thoughts
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,And I saw a tv turned on
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,with a blue screen with a guy narrating a race
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,it all looked real
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,but I felt it was a bit strange
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,it looked perfectly real
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I then got into other delusions like I was in hell
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,a lot of bullshit and stuff
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,but no major hallucinations despite that one
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,The thing was that I was in chronic stress and major restless
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,had to do a lot but I wasnt resting enough
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,Major emotional stuff I had to work and
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,for my bad luck
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I moved out to an apartment with a girl above my apartment that would just
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,hit furniture over the ground whenever she wanted just bc she wanted
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,It all started to get really bad when
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,by the night
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,around am she would wake me up EVERY night
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,and I would get in fight or flight mode and would be unable to sleep for the rest of the night
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I had to pick hotel rooms to sleep
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,bc the administrator here just would do nothing
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I couldnt make her stop
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,Now she stopped
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I dont have delusions nor hallucinations anymore
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,maybe my psychosis was bc of sleep deprivation with a lot of stress
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,emotional stuff and a lot of bs I had to go through
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,she finally stopped doing that now I can sleep normally the whole night
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,how do I know if Im still recovering
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I feel great
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I just have issues with fight or flight mode cause IM still stuck in it
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,and from time to time I feel stuff wanting to come out
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,  I try to eat healthy and exercise etc
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,but what I do most is hydrating myself a lot
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,enjoying hobbies and consuming supplements
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,vitamin B etc
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,How do I know if Im healthy enough regarding psychosis itself
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,I also heard that every event with have related to psychosis we lose a part of reality
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,a fraction of it
sbw7jq,t5_2tyg2,how does it can be explained
rn0ey6,t5_2s1h9,I was wondering how I add the medicine under my username
s6b4od,t5_2saq9,Have been writing out POTs with a lower case s
s6b4od,t5_2saq9,Realize the S is for syndrome
s6b4od,t5_2saq9,This explains the confusion
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,Can we get a punch card program
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,So just got off the phone with my neuro about my last mri
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,Ive had  known relapses since my first last July
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,And  MRIs in the time
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,I had  after my first MRI
s43ypd,t5_2s23e, more after my second
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,And another two after this third
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,Since Im also having more
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,new symptoms in the last couple of weeks she thinks Im having another relapse that makes  and that Ive probably gain at least one more
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,So like I said
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,can we get like a punch card or something for this
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,Every ten new lesions get a free spa day or something
s43ypd,t5_2s23e,we gotta be able to win something out of this
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,Astro Boy movie  might have almost given me epilepsy last night
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,Wondering if anyone experienced this watching this movie
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,Its near the end of the movie where there was an explosion with blue and red flashing lights
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,Im a male in my s and have never had epilepsy before
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,I did have a concussion in my late s and a few resultant classical migraine headaches in the next decade or so
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,I also have mild tinnitus for as long as I remember
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,though  of the time I dont notice it
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,While I was watching the explosion scene I had a very eerie sensation
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,Its slightly similar to the aura I have experienced at the onset of a migraine
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,but not quite
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,I could feel an epilepsy or at least what I imagine it to be coming
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,After a moment of that I looked away
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,A few minutes later
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,when the movie ended
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,I started having noticing ringing in my ear
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,I recall that some years ago in Japan a tv show triggered epilepsy in some children
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,and the news that night reported it and replayed it
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,which triggered another wave
rub7t5,t5_2s1h9,I googled Astro Boy epilepsy and found no reports
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,ear issues  LPR Hi
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Im F and at the end of October I started experiencing out-of-nowhere symptoms like jaw pain
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,followed by sinus and ear pain  pressure
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,constant need to pop them etc
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,After a week the jaw pain went away
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,but the ear issues stayed and maybe another week later
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I strated experiencing classic LPR symptoms
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Mainly throat congestion
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,burping and very often an acidic taste at the back of my throat
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,My ears were still the same during that time along with some itching
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I was then diagnosed with reflux
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,got Omeprazole for it
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,maybe  weeks after I strated taking it
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,the symptoms didnt improve a lot and on top of it
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I got bilateral tinnitus
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I went to my ENT again and asked if it could be because of the PPIs or reflux but he denied it
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,By then my reflux symptoms were better so he told me to continue the medication and started focusing on my tinnitus as a separate condition
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Was told I have perfect hearing
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,there is no fluid and my eardrums are fine
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,so they couldnt find the cause
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,But today my LPR flared a lot and along with it
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,so did my tinnitus
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,My ears itch and hurt a bit again
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I always thought the two to be related as they started only weeks away from each other
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,but discarded that thought because my doctors did
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Now I looked it up and apparently there are people who have tinnitusear issues as a symptom of reflux
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I also have hyperacusis
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Could it really be the cause of my tinnitus
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Could the PPIs be the cause
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I dont know if I should stop them because if I do
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,my reflux will worsen and so may the tinnitus
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,I was already taking them mg every other day the last  days
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,But if theyre the culprit
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Im also scared  months is too long and that stopping them wouldnt help anymore  Maybe switch to a different one
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Im still hoping that the ringing will improve if the reflux does
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,is this possible
s2a9xv,t5_2qlaa,Any and every answer appreciated

sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Just to Vent  I tend to be one who keeps things bottled up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However for my own mental health
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I decided to just vent here about it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,TLDR at bottom
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       So I have been having the worst life
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I understand that people in Africa are probably a lot worse off but to my own standards
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,my life has just not been good
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Starting from when I was young my school life was pretty horrible
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was constantly bullied and made fun of
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The reason being was that my clothes were continuously smelling like marijuana
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The bullying is what made me start to hate going to school
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I would try to fake sick a lot
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,just to not go
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Now you probably wondering why a child smelling like marijuana anyway
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And after saying that you probably found the answer
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,That answer is why I absolutely hate weed and would never smoke it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They would smoke EVERY SINGLE DAY
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Not giving a damn where they did it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,or what they did it near
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Thus brings in my uniform clothes
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Being smoked up and me having to wear them the next day
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I hated it so much
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Around the start of my th grade year
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My family broke up because of my mother cheating
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Her reasons for cheating
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I dont really care about at this point
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But after it happen my father decided to stop paying the rent to our apartment so we would lose it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We wind up moving to another city in a shitty basement
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,had to separate the kids room and parents room with a blanket hanging up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was then taking a train everyday to school to finish my th grade year
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Lots of times I wouldnt even go home early
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I would just try to chill with my older brother who lived with some people on the floor above our old apartment
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I really enjoyed spending time with him and looked up to him
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This made me happy so I did it a lot
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At my graduation my parents got me a suit from someplace
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But it was a weird silver suit that I was convinced into liking when I really didnt
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Whats worse is showing up to dance in that suit and seeing everyone wearing normal suits
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Did not make me feel good
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,and made it worse when the next day at graduation everyone wore a different suit and I again wore that same suit
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Im not sure what exactly happen over the summer but for some reason
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I guess because of arguments
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,my mother decided to leave and take us and go stay with our cousins for like a week at their fancy big house in New Jersey
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And then we went to a shelter after
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was a domestic violence shelter
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Which I can tell you now
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,we definitely was taking a room from some actual survivor of DV
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This would be the start of a trend because my high school life was also horrible
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I went to a lot of different high schools because I basically lived shelter to shelter
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,my sister and I would go into a shelter
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,go out and have our own apartment
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,lose that apartment SOMEHOW
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,and then be back in the shelter again
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I also had to wear clothing the shelter gave us which just made me feel horrible
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I slept a lot in school barely did work and was just fed up with how my life was at that point
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I couldnt wait till I could get home and lose myself In my games
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My high school graduation was no different then the first
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Went to prom alone
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,with a suit and tie that was giving to me by the shelter system
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Didnt even notice they gave me a tux shirt to wear with the suit jacket till I was at prom and someone pointed it out
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Dont even know why I even went to it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Graduation same thing
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,same tuxedo suit
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       When I graduated high school I thought it was time to finally be done with school in total so I decided not to pursue a college degree
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This would later effect me big time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But at this time I really didnt know what I wanted to do
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wanted to do game design but I would try to learn it through little websites with their own silly little engines
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I would run into problems though and everyone would be a complete asshole telling me to figure out the problem myself instead of just telling me what I did wrong
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This cause me to quit that and I really didnt know what I wanted to do
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It didnt help that I was constantly verbally abused by my father whenever he would visit my mom
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Constantly being told what I should be doing with my life
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Constantly being compared to my sister who decided to attend college
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Constantly being told that I should attend a trade school and become a shitty ass mechanic
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Ive had arguments a lot with him about this
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was always just something with him
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I also would like to point out that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,and Im sure most know
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but when you live with a parent and you arent working and you arent paying bills either
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,they really really hate that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Something about you just existing just pisses them off for some reason
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,regardless if you just keep to yourself
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I basically had to force myself to get a job and I did
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Wind up getting a nice lil job as a security guard
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was part time though but the pay was really good for a part time job
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Was able to pay my own little bills
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,buy what I wanted
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Bought the food I wanted to eat
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Thought I was going to be able to maybe save up and just do whatever but the more I bought what I wanted the more I made people mad
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Turns out that me working and buying what I want is just me wasting my money on foolish things
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Turns out that me working this Security Job is also me being lazy because I wont get a job where I am constantly on my feet doing something
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This will be a running theme later
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       My brother winds up moving in with my mother and that later on causes problems
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My mother who it seems wasnt even paying the rent at that time decided to move in with someone else leaving everyone at that apartment to fend for themselves
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was the first red flag I should of payed attention to
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My sister was in a dorm
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,so she was OK
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My brother was left there alone
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,and my father decided to take me in which he made sure to let me know that he didnt want to
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My brother and I have different fathers so there wasnt really any hope for him
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He winds up finding a place so that was good
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,When living with my dad it was horrible
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He lived with his sister and his family obsessed over the smallest or stupid of things
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Turning things that shouldnt be a problem into a problem
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Like not coming out the room to greet whoever is in the kitchen with a good morning
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Like what the hell
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Or getting upset because someone is their internet when they arent there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Going so far as to change the password on me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Silly things like this
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Not to mention I was still working my security job at this time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I had to commute  hours there and  hours back from New York to New Jersey
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Just for a little bit of money
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I also had a extra bill now
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I really didnt want to lose my things
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I put everything in storage
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I would later take some things out of storage to use at his house which to my surprise was the worse thing because when I put my things in the storage
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,some of it got infested with bed bugs
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So bringing the few things back to his place started a problem which I was definitely solely blamed for
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Because I of course knew that there was bed bugs in it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We manage to get rid of the bed bugs but didnt matter
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My father would complain that Im on my computer and not out doing something
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We would have lots of arguments too because he would try to tell me when I can or cant use my things
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,and it was the most annoying thing ever
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It would always just make my blood boil when someone who didnt contribute to what I have tells me what to do with it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was again a red flag that I should of really remembered
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       After constantly being blamed for things for no reason I was sick of living there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My mother called me and tried to borrow money from me because she was about to have nowhere to go
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She was having problems with the person she moved in with and now that person decided they was just going to move and leave her there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was ironic but also another red flag that for some reason I decided to let just pass me by
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So me being the good guy
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,who also has problems with the people he living with decided that I would lend my money to her so she can use it as a security deposit and get us a place we can live together
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wind up staying at a hotel with her and going to work from there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,she was a very supportive mother because I had helped her
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,You can kind of say she was at my beck and call
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,going so far to even wash my uniform clothes in the tub so that they would be clean
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We wind up finding a small little one bedroom on Craigslist
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was told I would have the room
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,which was barely a room in fact the whole place would turn out to be illegal
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She said she would have the living room as her room
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was basically like a reverse of the place we stayed at before she left my brother and I stranded
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Things were fine so far
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was closer to my job again but this time a  minute commute to it and not  hours
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My sister would start to live with us when it was school break
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,because colleges kick kids out their dorms on breaks
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,more people in the house now so of course more problems
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My mother started complaining more about things
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,not only did it make no sense to complain about
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but also it was things SHE DID
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So it made  sense
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She also needed to borrow money a lot for some reason
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,just for her habits
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she would constantly borrow from me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She borrowed a bit from my sister but my sister shut that down real quick after a point
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She was smart
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,she saw the flags
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was a fool
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So being the person I am I let her borrow money time and time again
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And all I asked was that when I needed the money to please pay me back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I never rushed anyone to pay me back or anything like that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Just give me it when I need it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Well when you give people things it all good
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but when its time to pay back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My mother happen to get some money
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,which I believe was income tax
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this point I was assuming she would pay me back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,When I asked her about if she was going to
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,her response was
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Once I pay you and your sister
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I will have nothing left
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Now this was strange and I am confused why this was said to me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but Im not really sure how exactly thats my problem
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I mean call me crazy but dont you borrow money because you need the money right then and there and cant wait to save up to use it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It would make total sense for you to now
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,after borrowing money
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,to use the new money you got to pay back the lender But I guess not
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,After arguments about it I was finally given a good amount of my money back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,with the promise of paying the rest back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was content so it didnt matter
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       Now you are probably wondering why I posted this here
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Well this part is where that answer comes
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,One day I happen to wake up and look in the mirror and half of my face is drooping
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wind up getting soap in my eyes too because of this
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,which effected my vision for awhile
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So just remember to always look in the mirror before you shower
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,called an ambulance went to hospital
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Found out I had MS
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wasnt even mad really
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,since I was told Ill be kind of OK
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Since they have all TYPES OF MEDICINES THESE DAYS WOOHOO
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,That is until you find out you have to take said medicine every single day for the rest of your life
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I already hate taking meds so this just really hit me hard
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But I kept it to myself using my its whatever attitude
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My mother tone changed as well
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She was starting to and trying to do a lot of stuff for me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Which I really didnt enjoy because it felt like it was for show
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Of course it was but I didnt really notice until I had the chance to think back on it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was also starting to see the switch up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,me having MS was totally forgotten so everything went back to how it was
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Arguments and complaints
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,When my mother and I first got this place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I had gotten internet only
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I told my mom she would not need cable because anything on cable can be seen on the internet
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She insisted to get cable as well and said she would pay the difference
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,After a point she stop paying for the cable and made it into a tab
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I didnt mind at the time because I again had a job and wasnt really paying much
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However I would go on to lose that security job after four years
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then informed my mom
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,because of how high the cable and internet bill was
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,that she needs to give me something because this will eat into my savings eventually
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Things still became a problem and I wind up turning the cable part off
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,which she wanted me to do
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,because she insisted that she doesnt need the cable either
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,when I did turn it off
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,this really upset her
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This will also be a running theme
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was then told I need to find a place to move to because she was going to move with some old lady in a room in her apartment
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Anyway my sister was there and had just finished school
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My sister was fed up with it as well so me and her both agreed to find us a place and live together and be away from the parent bullshit
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My sister was working and I was looking for a place and a new job at the same time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,seeing me go out constantly became very noisy
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,To the point where she inserted herself to come with me and my sister to see one of our places
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And then would constantly try to find things wrong with the place so we wouldnt get it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She never even cared about this until she found out my sister and I would be living together
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Not sure what she was thinking but after a while
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,out of nowhere
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,she suddenly found a  bedroom for us to move into together and split
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Which I was fine with because I was not going to ever be paying rent for a place Im living while also being told what I can and cant do in my own place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We decided on who gets what bedroom and signed the lease
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Minutes after my mother would then try to take my bedroom and make me have hers
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,which was the littlest one
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Which was not going to happen since we didnt agree on that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Red flag I definitely should of seen
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       So at this point I am in this new place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,my own room
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I am currently taking Gilenya for my MS and I am about to start my new job
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I felt like everything would start to get better
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However it didnt
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I thought this job was going to be purely tech support and I was ecstatic because I am a computer guy
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I am about to get payed for something that I am constantly doing already
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I do training and then am informed that the company I work for
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,well they basically loan their employees to other companies and I would have to work under their policies
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And boy oh boy who do I get
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I hated them as a service and now I am going to have to work for them
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I thought it would be OK at first until I was forced to get at least  sales a week
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This might seem like nothing but for someone who turned down a sales job because they couldnt do it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,this was a lot for me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Not only that but I was so used to just letting customers go after helping them with the reason they called
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was pretty hard for me to swindle these old people into upgrading their plans
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wind up getting headaches and stressing over it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It got to a point where as a work at home job I was calling out because I couldnt take just sitting at my PC and having to deal with it all
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My headaches can also be contributed to the fact that I was no longer having any medication
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,When I was getting my medicine it was through Medicaid
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And it turns out that If you make at least  a month
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,then they was no longer going to cover you
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I made 
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,living wage in NJ is 
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This makes a lot of sense to me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Anyway I had no medicine so I would have constant headaches
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Things would easily cause them to come for me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I called out a lot
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I needed some form of insurance to help cover this  a month
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My job was at that moment not giving me insurance
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I had to wait till the next Jan st to be covered
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was told to look into some type of charity insurance
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I spoke to them however they would not cover me unless they got some proof from my job that they did not cover me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I had to then run around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to figure out who am I suppose to speak to for this
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I finally found the people and just my luck these people dont EVER answer phone calls or emails
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So Im sitting there constantly messaging them
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Hey have you got my message
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Hoping they would reply
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This just added onto the stress
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was written up a lot for missing days also
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Its funny because I should of known this would happen when I missed a day for my training to go to the doctor and they decided it was inexcusable and made me no longer entitled to the  cent extra an hour raise after training ends
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Because of the days I missed
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wind up getting fired
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,THE DAY AFTER I WAS FIRED I WAS FINALLY MESSAGED BY THE INSURANCE PEOPLE
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They told me that because I no longer worked for them I could not get the insurance
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This absolutely made my blood boil
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then came back to Medicaid and was able to get insurance again
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I went with the plan they provided me because it seemed a bit fancy
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They was talking about housing and food and all of that stuff
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Problem with that though
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,is that they was not covering my Gilenya
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They said yea no
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,that medicine waaay too expensive
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So after taking a few months to even find this out
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I decided to switch back to my old plan from Medicaid that did cover it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       So at this point my neurologist said
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Since you have these problems with coverage and taking medicine I dont want to put you on to medicine and then you later are no longer able to take it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I will try to put you onto Maven Clad which you wont have to take everyday for the rest of your life
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I said OK that sounds really good
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I just had to wait now for my insurance to cover it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,haha they wont
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They absolutely refused
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They wanted me to take Gilenya or any other of the daily medicines again
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They wanted me to try at least  medicines including Gilenya which I dont see how they dont even understand I took Gilenya already
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But they wanted me to try the  first and if they DONT WORK
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,then I can use Maven Clad
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The problem with this is that it wasnt about them not working
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was about me not being able to get them anymore
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I had to wait and wait and wait
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was on unemployment after this
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And the company I worked for decided to fight against me saying I dont deserve unemployment because I broke the rules
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,needing to come to work no exceptions
sv08xm,t5_2s23e, I had to go against them myself not knowing anything and ultimately I lose
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I could of did the whole fight back but after seeing I would only just lose like  thousand and can still get unemployment I decided to just let it go
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I didnt want to deal with it anymore
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Around the time I had about  months left on my unemployment COVID happen
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was absolutely terrified of COVID and did not want to get it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I assume with my MS
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,it was a death sentence
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The bright side of this was unemployment increasing  dollars
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Unfortunately my unemployment was about to run out anyway so it didnt matter too much
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The extra pay was nice though
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,To be honest
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I can probably deal with a stressful Job if Im making  a week from it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Thats life changing money for someone like me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,it was then decreased to  dollars
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,OK cool thats still fine
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Im still paying my bills and other things with it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,After that my unemployment ended
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was trying to get an extension for it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I really messed up here because I should of kept looking for a job
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wanted one remotely but did not want to have to do a job that was tech support and sales
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And it seems like almost all jobs that dont require degrees
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,are tech support and sales mixed in one
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Turns out more experience you have
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,the less work you have to do
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Anyway I put myself in a jam
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was only doing the minimum require to find a job to continue getting unemployment
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Just in case
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And I was making way more on unemployment then I did working anyway so why try to work when employers wont offer more
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So after COVID happen my mother lost her job
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She was using savings to pay rent too and her savings was going very low
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She I believe quit because of a fall or something like that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she couldnt get unemployment
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She started borrowing money from the only person she could
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Which I gave her
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At a certain point my sister had problems with living with us
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was because of things that my mom was known for and she didnt want to be near me anymore because I wouldnt clean the bathroom when she wanted me to
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We had rules but a lot of times I would get headaches and not do what I was suppose to at that time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I would do it like a day after or something
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Either way after a point she got really mad about this and an argument started
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she decided to move out at the end of the lease
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My mother had the galls to try to say I was the one who should move out
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I said sure okay
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However my sister didnt want to live with her either
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So when she said she still moving out my mother changed her tune again quick fast
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Trying to make it seem as if she didnt mean anything by what she said
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Because it was me and my mom now we had to split the rent between us now
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Which would be a lot
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,my mother decided to get government assistance so that they could pay the rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The problem with this is that I was there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They was not going to help pay unless I moved out
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So my mother acted as if I was not there anymore
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,and contacted the landlords to take my name off the lease
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Making it solely in her name
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I really regret me allowing this to happen but I didnt know any better at the time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,my mother was still in talks with them along with borrowing money from me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Money for weed
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,money for cigarettes
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,it would just keep adding up and up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Till a point where she would owe me somewhere of k
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       There was a thing saying Im allowed an extension on my unemployment
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It would also give me  per weak as well if I could get it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,In total this would be a lot of money for me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I let my mom know about it and she was all in
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,With her getting her money and mine
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They plan was to get a place in like PA
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And I get a job again save up without having to pay rent and I save up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was a cool plan but the way she described it was as if I would be staying there for a looong time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I did not want this
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wanted to have my own place with no one around
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was especially tired of coming out my room to smell weed smoke all the time anyway
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this time of living here the rent was not being payed and was piling up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The assistance people decided now they would help since my mother was By her self The only problem is that they found out my mother was getting some type of big money and they said she would need to pay them back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she got upset about this and basically blamed me saying I should be paying some of that back to her
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I didnt agree because thats not of anything what we discussed
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Besides Im not sure how you would get to take my name off lease for assistance but I would need to pay back when you wouldnt get that assistance if my name wasnt removed in the first place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Going back on words was also a running theme
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My savings again would start to run low and I would tell my mom she needs to start trying to pay me back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Give me something anything
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We had the old cable set up again and of course she wasnt giving me money for that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I also was not getting any unemployment
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I couldnt even get in contact with anyone
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It would always just say call again tomorrow
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Waking up early to call them just for them to say nope call tomorrow was annoying
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So after telling my mom she had to start paying me back because I have nothing and at this time she started getting SSI she started to act funny
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Making remarks like I am suppose to give her money on something or something else
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I refused to give her money on rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but the Light bill I was willing because we had agreement on that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However she wasnt paying the light bill either
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And I did not want to give someone who borrows money from me and not pay bills
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,my money to pay a bill
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wanted to write a money order to PSEG and pay them that way
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,when of course she was ready to pay the bill herself
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,That time never came
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but smart remarks did
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was then making a plate of food and heading back to my room to do what I always have done when I heard her make a remark about me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Oh wow I owe you
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,you owe me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This confused me because from what I know I dont owe her anything
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I never borrowed from her at all
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I turned around to find out what she actually talking about
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She then again tried to say she owes me but I owe her for the rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I told her first off I dont owe you for rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,We had no discussion of me paying rent after you taking my name off lease
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She already was saying who is and is not allowed to come in her house and if I had to pay rent she wouldnt at all be saying any of that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I allowed it because I was not paying rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then let her know
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,if I was to owe someone rent it wouldnt be you
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,it would be the landlord
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She then asks me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,with a sad expression kind of face
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,that arent I going to help her move to PA
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I said yea but what does that have to do with anything
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She makes assumptions after which leads me to believe like she wanted me to give her all of the money I would be getting from unemployment if they finally give me it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This together with the I owe you you owe me thing made me really mad
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was again felt like people were telling me what I can or cant do with my things
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I let her know again that I dont owe her anything she owes me and that I shouldnt have to say that Im helping to move
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Since I am moving too with her its a given
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then left and went back to my room but I notice she had a puzzled almost angry look on her face before leaving
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The next day I would wake up to her texting me different calculations of things I would have to pay
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then let her know yea I would pay those things once you give me my money back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Because again I am not paying you it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I am paying the people the bill is for
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,That made her extremely mad
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she tried to say that I would now have to move out
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I said OK cool
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Ill find a place now and do that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I started looking
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She then told me she was not going to be paying her portion of the cable anymore and to shut it off
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I waited a bit
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,simply because I just didnt feel like it and then shut the cable off
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I guess she forgot because this made her very angry
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She then tried to turn off the power to my room
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,stating because I didnt give her any money for a light bill
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was funny to me because the amount of money she owed me she could of easily said well that parts for the light bill
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But she didnt she just used it as an excuse whenever it suit her
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Either I owed money for the light bill or I owed money for the rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but the money she owed me always contributed to the other
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Either way I had to give her all that money together and then I guess she would then pay me back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,That was definitely not going to happen
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       After she turned the power off I turned it back on
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she decided to turn it off again and stand in front of it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Asserting her dominance I assume
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The power going off and on actually breaks my computer
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I then would have to spend like  dollars replacing the part that broke
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Back to the lights I wind up getting up and because the power box was open I reached behind her to turn my power back on
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She then flinches and swats my hand away saying I lost my mind
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,When she puts her hands on me it angers me but I give her the benefit of the doubt because of the person I am and tells her she better not do it again
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She then calls the cops and tells them I am acting erratic
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then call the cops later and ask them when they going to get here
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The cops finally arrive and they start talking to each of us separately
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this time my cousin
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,well one of the ones who lived in the fancy house comes over
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Seems my mother was calling everyone she could saying I put my hands on her
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The police are talking to us both and I tell them exactly what happen
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The police says yea yall both just stay in yall rooms and dont talk to each other
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was OK because thats what I already do so it didnt matter
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,She was so adamant on trying to have them arrest me though
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,To the point of starting to cry and saying she scared
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The police didnt care
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,they even told her that because of COVID it was illegal to turn off my power and that If she did it again they would arrest her
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They also told her that I lived her and that I couldnt be kicked out This definitely upset her because she changed her tune into Why would he do this when she has done so much for me and took care of me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was really thrown back at this because it quite frankly wasnt true so I started to giggle
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My cousin looks at me and then asks why am I laughing
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I start to explain to her that I am laughing because people are lying
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,but before I can even finish letting the words come out my mouth she makes an I dont care hand gesture and walks away
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this point Im like wow
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So Im like let me go ahead and look for a place to get the hell out of here
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So what happens now is that because I wasnt arrested or kicked out it made my mother very mad
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she had a better idea
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Since her name is on the lease she would just move out
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,thus I would definitely be kicked out because the tenant whose name on the lease doesnt live there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I would be squatting
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So she does just that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Now I am trying to take care of myself there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,While also trying to not let stuff stress me because of the MS while also trying to find a place to move to
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this point my dad calls me out of nowhere
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He doesnt like my mom so assumes everything he heard was lies and he wanted to hear it from me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He at that time was the only one who even asked me my side
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,No one else did
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I let him know and he tried to be there for me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It was different and it just felt like he somewhat cared so I cared a bit too
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He was being told he had to leave his sister place as well
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I told him if he wanted to just move in with me and we get us a place together
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He agreed and made a lot of big promises like being the one who cooks so I can eat healthier and stuff like that
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Miraculously as well I finally got my unemployment money
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The whole k so before I was going to use this to clear my debts because of stupid decisions I made trying to do drop shipping
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But now I was going to use this for security deposit and rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I felt pretty good now
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was looking for a place we could share
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wanted at least  bedrooms for myself so I was searching for a  bedroom
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was planning to give my dad the biggest bedroom because I would have  and we would be splitting the rent half way anyway
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He tells me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,you know Im going to have the biggest bedroom right
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was a red flag but it was something I already was planning anyway so I didnt really care
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I said yes because I have two rooms and we both laughed about it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I would later have trouble continuing to look for a place because the landlord
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,or specifically the management did not want me there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Even though I told them my dad would come and we can start a new lease
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Even if they wanted to raise the rent like they was trying to get at
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They still did not want to let me stay
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They even said that my mother told them I would pay the left over rent too before moving out
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They then turned my power off and when I called police about it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The officers who came basically spoke to the lady on the phone out of listening range and then came back to me saying that they was not going to do anything because I was not suppose to be there
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then decided to at least charge my phone in hall way to get some power to keep looking for a place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I couldnt even shower either because the water was just too cold
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The management would then screw close the hall way outlets so I couldnt use them
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But I just unscrewed them back and used them
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They would then call the cops on me but different officers came and said yea no and also yall turning off his power was illegal
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They told me I could sue if I wanted to but I just didnt care
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I just wanted to leave already
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I manage to find a place and after a bit we moved in
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Day  of living in this new place my father already started complaining
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He complained about how the place was since I was the only one to see it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Mind you this is my first time even getting a place myself and I really didnt know what to look for
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I also didnt really want the place either but they were the only ones to accept me and I just wanted to leave and be able to shower in hot water
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       To get this place I used my own money to pay the security deposit and I payed the first months rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Because my dad had nothing
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He worked but he would bullshit his money on weed and cigs as well
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So he never had any savings
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So now he had to pay me back now for half a months rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,After we settled in I notice he was talking a lot to people about the place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,It sounded almost as if I lived with him and not we both got this place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I was really confused too when he invited my sister over to see the place
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And decided to just open my rooms door to let her see inside
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Was very disrespectful to me but I let it slide
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Later on he would tell me that I need to put all my stuff into one room just in case my sister wanted to come over to spend a night because she would need a room to be in
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Now if you dont know me by now
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,yes this pissed me off
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I didnt care if he said it in a joking matter
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Just saying it pisses me off
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,How dare you
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He then tries to tell me that the big bedroom is his
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My bedroom where my bed is-is mine and the second room I have and everywhere else in the house is what we share
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this point I was questioning whether he was actually insane
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I would later learn yes
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He would then keep telling me things he heard is going on with my mom even though I didnt care about it since she was dead to me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He would then start to complain about how things were in the house and why I wasnt cleaning up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,The problem with this is that everything that was dirty
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,was dirty because of him
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He would spill coffee on the floor and leave to go to work
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,then get mad at me because I didnt clean it up
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And his reasoning is that its because I am not doing anything anywaysince I wasnt working That just didnt make sense to me so of course arguments would start
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,They would be
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,not too crazy but it would definitely be about the stupidest of things
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,At this point I knew it was a problem living with him
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However he would always change his attitude like a day after
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,making me think OK maybe I can put up with him for awhile
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,All the bills are in my name as well and he would just assume how much it would be and send me money to pay it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However the money would not be enough so I would just add it on to what he owes me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He then would get mad when I told him he owed me for it going so far as to assume Im lying and requesting I show him proof
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I showed him proof and he still doesnt even care
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,But I just ignore it and tell him the math he doing is wrong
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,In fact the math he tried to do would make him owe me more money but Im not going to let that happen
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I wanted exactly whats owed
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,not less not more
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So he says hell pay me back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I ask him when and he says he doesnt know
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This pisses me off because its like saying you arent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He doesnt even make an effort to pay me back per week either
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So Im stuck just hoping he pays me back
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Currently we are  months into our  month lease and I have not been payed back a dime
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,       In fact I dont think I will ever get payed back because a few days ago we got into a heated argument where we was going to fight
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And I was hoping we did because I really wanted to let all the built up anger I had my entire life out on someone
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,However I dont trust these people and they are quick to call the cops and make up lies so I wanted him to at least go first so I can be the one defending myself
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,His excuse of not making the move was saying I would call the cops as well
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Even though he was the one who first started saying he would put his hands on me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,And this whole argument started because I asked him why he took my shampoo out of the bathroom
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,His reasoning was that it was his
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I offered to show him receipts and I showed him his actual shampoo that he put in the bathroom along with another shampoo I purchased with my other one that were identical and different from his and he still didnt care
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Started calling me names and making threats saying
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,only a bitch would keep receipts
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,HAHA I bought this shampoo literally  days ago
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Of course I couldnt believe this and retaliated back with my own insults
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I then told him if he feels that way he can just leave
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He didnt give a security deposit
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,he didnt give first month rent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,he not paying rent now because of a hole in ceiling that we wanted landlord to fix before we gave rent and he hasnt bothered to give me money for any of the other bills either
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I told him just leave
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,He basically responds with no u like the dummy he is
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So basically I told him to shut up and stop talking to me
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was the end of the argument
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Now I am currently trying to get a remote job once again and want to just make enough where I can just live by myself and at least leave this crappy expensive state
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I dont want to be around these people at all and dont want them to even know where I am at
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I have been trying my best to find any remote job
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Even willing to take the dreaded tech support sales job
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I am not getting any call backs though which is understandable based on my experience
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,which makes me regret not going to college
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I dont even have enough to finish paying my portion of the lease
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I hate it so much
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,and just wish I could go back in time and be my own father figure to myself to guide me on getting away from this much earlier
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This is so frustrating and Im sorry if it is long
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I dont really have anyone to talk to and most people dont care
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I can just tell by the look in their eyes
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,My brother even tried to tell me that I should forgive my mother even if I did go to jail
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I cant stand it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,I have been having thoughts but honestly I wouldnt even be able to go through with it unless it was super easy and quick
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,So I just forget about it
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,All I want now is just a job so I can just move
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Sorry if this was long
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,This was the first time I threw out my problems and I just needed to vent
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Theres even a lot of stuff I didnt even say that makes people look far worse but this isnt about that its just me venting
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Thanks for reading I only have to say if any family members giving you a hard time
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Make plans to stay away immediately
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,There is no law that forces you to talk to family members and dont let them guilt trip you into thinking you owe them anything
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,No one is brought into this world by their own choice
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,You dont owe anyone anything for being on this planet
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,TLDR Family can be the biggest detriment to your health
sv08xm,t5_2s23e,Stay away from toxic family members and dont give them a chance to ruin you
s14zb2,t5_2tyg2,do you also like the feeling of delusions disappearing
s14zb2,t5_2tyg2,Even though its really painful for a moment when I realize everything is just made up in my mind
s14zb2,t5_2tyg2,after a while I feel better
s14zb2,t5_2tyg2,and I even like the pain of realizing all the false believes because the realization and with that the pain finally feels like something real and I feel down to earth for a moment
s14zb2,t5_2tyg2,But then the next day my delusion might come back
s14zb2,t5_2tyg2,i feel like I have so little control over it

roijgo,t5_2r876,After a  week admission on pretty intense iv antibiotics  days later I started experiencing itching on my penis foreskin mainly
roijgo,t5_2r876,so I bought some calestene cream for girl yeast infections its what the pharmacy recommended
roijgo,t5_2r876,Today is the second day and I have swelling and discharge
roijgo,t5_2r876,Coming from the foreskin
roijgo,t5_2r876,thing is I am unable to retract it barely at all and I cannot clean it that good this is not a new issue but Ive never had issues its Christmas I have absolutely no way In getting in touch with a doctor I called a nurse and she told me I should see a doctor as soon as I can
roijgo,t5_2r876,This is very extremely annoying and scary Im assuming it is a yeast infection from antibiotics and I dont know what to do until I can see i doctor

roijgo,t5_2r876,Its very annoying
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,Can you describe inflammation
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,Probably a dumb question
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,but scheduled for my first rheumatologist appointment next  week
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,GP has mostly ruled out celiac but considering lupus or RA
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,Positive ANA test
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,all other tests are negativenormal and yes
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,Ive done enough research to know these tests dont specifically confirm or deny AI
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,I have multiple symptoms that could be auto immune but they also could just be bad luck and I have multiple
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,different and unrelated symptoms
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,The one thing Im trying to figure out is what inflammation looks like
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,I have a lot of problems with my joints knees
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,shoulders as well as upper and lower back pain  pain is fairly consistent daily - and can get up to an  at worst
rlfx40,t5_2rtve,Sometimes the severe pain will last hoursdays and sometimes itll be a short burst of pain and then done

p752e1,t5_2r876,Those of you who are experts on CFRD I need some education on this topic
p752e1,t5_2r876,I want to start testing at home but am unsure how to do it
p752e1,t5_2r876,Im pretty knowledgeable about CF
p752e1,t5_2r876,but know next to nothing about CFRD  My glucose tolerance test is in the pre-diabetic range again
p752e1,t5_2r876,Ive had normal results for eight years since I was last in the pre-diabetic range
p752e1,t5_2r876,My ALT and AST are elevated
p752e1,t5_2r876,but Im also on trikafta
p752e1,t5_2r876,My doctor is great and Ill bring this up with him as well
p752e1,t5_2r876,but since it isnt yet diabetes according to their tests they wont pay for diabetic treatment
p752e1,t5_2r876,Kaiser is also not a provider of CGM devices as some people in my family that do have diabetes tried to get it and failed
p752e1,t5_2r876,Anything you have on the topic of at home testing is greatly appreciated where to get it
p752e1,t5_2r876,when to test
p752e1,t5_2r876,what foods correlate with what results

p4y266,t5_2r876,but ever since Trikafka
p4y266,t5_2r876,I have been struggling mightily with acne
p4y266,t5_2r876,What have you guys done to resolve this issue
p4y266,t5_2r876,The only thing that alleviates the issue is going to the hospital and having IV antibiotics or a harsh regimen that once Im off the acne comes back
p4y266,t5_2r876,Thanks for all your advice in advance
p4y266,t5_2r876,Im a male

r6c29h,t5_2rtve,New to lupus already done with it Im so confused by lupus
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,I was dx this summer and just had some joint pain to start with
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,These last two weeks have been awful for me though
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,Could barely walk from pain
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,low grade fevers
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,and my lower back feels like someone is just punching me over and over again
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,My rheumatologist put me on a tapered dose of prednisone that helped at first
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,but once the dose lowered
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,the pain got bad again
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,My pcp uped my dose of prednisone
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,but my question is is this how its going to be with lupus
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,Where you get to barely functioning and there isnt a whole lot you can about it
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,I only sleep until about  in the morning
r6c29h,t5_2rtve,and docs dont seem helpful with that either
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,CF and Anxiety Hey all
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,So Im going to make this as condensed as possible
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,I think my reasoning for this post is just basic discussion and other peoples experience if any
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,Ive HAD anxiety pretty much all my life even before my CF was a real issue in my life
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,Basically Im at a point now where Ive had more issues with the disease since I cultured pseudomonas and MAC Avium a year ago which was caused me a lot more anxiety
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,I have symptoms like shortness of breath
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,heavy feeling in chest
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,feeling like I cant breathe all that fun anxiety stuff
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,The problem with this is I dont know if Im having a flare up or if its just anxiety
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,It happens around the same time everyday and even after the attack is over I still dont feel well the rest of the day
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,Also my team knows about this and so do my doctors I do not hide my anxiety and I do have coping mechanisms it has just been more harder recently
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,So thats pretty much it
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,Feel free to rant or discuss down below if you guys would like
sy3h8f,t5_2r876,just needed to vent a bit I guess
scgb56,t5_2s23e,Those of you that have told people about your diagnosis
scgb56,t5_2s23e,do you regret it
scgb56,t5_2s23e,I swear I am going to lose my mind if one more person tries to be helpful and tell me what I need to do or what I cant
scgb56,t5_2s23e,I know its done in love and I am so incredibly thankful that I have people that care
scgb56,t5_2s23e,but god I am so tired of being reminded that I am sick  So if youve told people
scgb56,t5_2s23e,do you regret it
scgb56,t5_2s23e,Or I guess my other question is
scgb56,t5_2s23e,how do you KINDLY deal with people
scgb56,t5_2s23e,idk over stepping
scgb56,t5_2s23e,Or is just this life now

snylcu,t5_2s23e,just venting i guess i just needed it off my chest
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,Is it just me
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,So I had a flurry of issues starting about a year ago now and just a few months ago I was diagnosed with lupus
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,I have all the regular symptoms most people experience
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,however my most concerning symptom I cant seem to find anyone else having
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,Almost every night while trying to fall asleep or in the morning as I wake up I have this strange sense of internal vibrating in my whole body
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,I dont physically shake but I feel like everywhere especially my chest is vibrating inside my body
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,Its unnerving and Ive gotten almost no help from my doctors
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,Just wondering if anyone relates to this or if its something else
s3tebh,t5_2rtve,Thank you everyone
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,Does any one else struggle with the difference in abilities between yourself and your partner
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,Its starting to cause a strain in my relationship
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,My partner is wonderful
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,he helps with my iv infusions and takes care of me
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,However I have gotten sicker since we started dating almost  years ago
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I think part of it is depression but I struggle the most with crippling fatigue chronic pain
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,and brain fog
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I was so active before I got diagnosed and I was relatively active when we started dating but lately its all I can do to walk around NYC a few times a week
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,My partner is irritatingly healthy and loves to run
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I cant help but envy him some times
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,The difference in our abilities is really stark right now
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I cant go out with him and his friends like a normal partner
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I know I am also depressed so thats definitely not helping things
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I just hate this illness
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,Its so hard to be a shell of myself
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I dont know what to do
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I am starting saphenello tomorrow
rq5h1v,t5_2rtve,I hope that helps
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,Struggling to comfort or console my spouse My lupus is active this is the first time my condition has been concerning enough that Im in the process currently of introductory benlysta infusions Ive had two this far
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,basically an infusion every two weeks for the first  doses and then move to monthly basis
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,Im also on plaquenil
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,I also have steroid topicals for rash
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,Currently symptoms are
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,malar rash
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,some stiffness and joint pain but that seems to be easing up
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,Had low platelets so easy to bruise
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,but not low enough to be concerning such as bleeding etc
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,No evidence of Kidney activity or any other organs thus far
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,Before starting benlysta I was on a round of prednisone and did topicals for my rash and it cleared up some
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,discontinued the steroids just prior to my covid booster shot and  weeks after that started the benlysta
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,My rash is coming back so Im starting up the topicals again
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,This morning while were getting ready for work he points out that my rash is getting worse and asks me if Im taking my medication and I got defensive about it
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,Yes I know hes worried
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,like Im worried too
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,but I explained that his questioning like that made me feel like he was blaming me for my symptoms
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,I tried explaining that I felt blindsided by it and I was focused on getting ready for work
qdklxe,t5_2rtve,How do you and your partnersfamily address it

sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,How do I tell the difference between Hypnopompic Hallucinations and psychotic hallucinations in the morning
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,Except the little flickers and sound distortions and stuff
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,I rarely have hallucinations during the day
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,but when those occur they are usually prominent and external
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,but a lot of the time before I take my meds in the morning I also have hallucinations
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,They can be on my way out of my room
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,or while in bed
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,eyes open or closed I often like to try falling back asleep for a couple more hours since I have poor sleep
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,Today it was like I looked up at the ceiling and there were  different voices
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,even talking over my inner voice
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,But I closed my eyes again and it was like a movie or reel to reel
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,and then I opened again and that was kind of fading away
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,A distinct feature I would add is that they had different ages
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,but Ive been hyperanalizing my personality recently and that was on the brain
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,so whether they corresponded to that or not and they did
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,I also happened to have this on the brain lately
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,There was multiple distinct phrases
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,It was almost like watching a movie or a buzzing conversation
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,It wasnt long
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,but I didnt hear anything the rest of the day after I took my meds
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,I had other distresses today
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,but only visual flicker hallucinations stayed after I was up and going
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,I only care about mornings because its a really frequent thing for me
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,I have had in the past situations that were way more obviously psychotic before
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,where voices were coming from directions and were loud
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,This wasnt like that
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,more like faded and almost a murmur of chatter within my head
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,which is more typical for me
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,TLDR I often have hallucinations in the morning before or immediately after I get out of bed directly before taking meds
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,I tend to have less after Ive gotten up and taken my meds
sppxu0,t5_2tyg2,so I wonder whether the morning ones are Hypnopompic Hallucinations or psychotic hallucinations and what the difference is
sne6qe,t5_2rtve,how safe is taking covid vaccine for someone suffering from lupus

sqz68g,t5_2saq9,syncope ER exasperation Far from my ideal Saturday morning   I may likely be adding more to this as the brain fog continues to wear off and the process of making thoughts and feelings more coherent is easier if a task
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,But suffice it to say on one hand it was mildly exasperating
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,while the phys asst
sqz68g,t5_2saq9, nurses seemed supportive and to be good at listening etc
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Just recently got discharged from the ER not to long ago
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Syncope happened at approx  am
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,After a lot of bs I finally opted to let the emts take me to a hospital
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Tends not to be my go to
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,but there has been  major episodes over the last  weeks
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Plus what heavily amounted to we need to vacate everybody and you are dragging us behind being able to do xyz pushed me to just opt to go to the ER in the aftermath   After X-rays of chest
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,CT Scan of head
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,blood tests to check for iron
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,and so on        EMT at ER did the orthoststic testing sitting
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,BP I asked for HR to be included    My sitting was approx  hr
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,standing was  HR
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,with BP stayed about the same
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,I asked if it was normal to rise so much
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,EMT Jay said yeah that was normal
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Me a thirty beat jump is normal
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,EMT Jay well normally its more like 
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Are you on beta blocker
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Me no     The doctor came in to tell me I was being diagnosed with dehydration and malnutrition
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,This after I was told early on that this is a teaching hospital and that the doctor will likely ask the same questions as the phys assit
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,already asked so I was anticipating more of a conversation or discussion   However when the physician assistant came in to walk me through all the results from all the testing my blood work came back not severelyseriously dehydrated
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,  They had sussed that I was dehydrated because when they did the orthoststic test  poor mans tilt table test my heart rate jumped up - points beteeen sitting and standing
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,  I asked them that Given that summation
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,that I was curious about a redo of the orthoststic reading following the IV bag of fluids
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,  Right before I was discharged the nurse had me stand up for the vitals  I went to sit down and he said that wasnt necessary they only needed to get the standing
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,Standing HR 
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,sitting Hr not too long before was 
sqz68g,t5_2saq9,BP stayed approx the same as before

svzz25,t5_2saq9,laying down was  bpm and blood pressure was 
svzz25,t5_2saq9,While standingleaning I was -bpm and then at  minutes I nearly fainted and laid back down

svzz25,t5_2saq9,I followed the NASA lean test

suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Aflorex or other probiotics for IBS D your experiences
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Hi all   I can see only one post on this from  years ago so it would be great to hear from you
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Im F with IBS D
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Officially diagnosed - years ago but had symptoms for years before
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,I recently realised I have learnt to live with my symptoms and just put up with the urgency
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,I have taken peppermint oil tablets and deflatine on ad hoc occasions when Ive been bloated
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,They help a bit but not loads
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Anyway the question
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Ive seen a bit about probiotics online and Aflorex has mostly good reviews and scientific backing
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Have you tried Aflorex
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,How did you get on
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Or have you tried any other probiotics
suvin3,t5_2s3g1,Im worried about any initial side effects too
pmiq26,t5_2r876,Shouldnt you be sicker
pmiq26,t5_2r876,I recently told a new friend that I have CF
pmiq26,t5_2r876,she responded by saying oh like from that movie referring to  feet apart and I said yes
pmiq26,t5_2r876,And then she paused and said
pmiq26,t5_2r876,but like shouldnt you be much sicker
pmiq26,t5_2r876,And basically looked me up and down
pmiq26,t5_2r876,This was on top of a mountain after a strenuous trail run and the whole way up I trying to hold my cough and farts in the entire way
pmiq26,t5_2r876,I have been said many worse things before about my CF and I know most people in this community have too
pmiq26,t5_2r876,but for some reason this one is bothering me so much
pmiq26,t5_2r876,I am doing so well for the first time in so long
pmiq26,t5_2r876,and this new friend has only known me in this time of doing pretty good and then that is her response
pmiq26,t5_2r876,like she was disappointed that I wasnt on oxygen and IVs dancing around the hospital for her
pmiq26,t5_2r876,We both have since moved to different parts of the country but she is coming to visit me in the winter
pmiq26,t5_2r876,Im excited for her to come but feeling extra self conscious about doing my treatments and everything in front of her
sy0o82,t5_2s3g1,What do I do when I get really sick and get into that brain fog where I literally do not have the energy to think
sy0o82,t5_2s3g1,What do you suggest how do I get back into my groove
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Eye twitching and seizures My right eye seems to twitchjerk a lot
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,A lot of times pretty much every day
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Sometimes its barely noticeable and sometimes its bad enough to where it literally causes my eye to shut
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,I feel like rubbing my eye helps it go away
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,I asked my doctor if this is related to my seizures because back in  I had my first TC seizure out of nowhere while I saw sleeping
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Since then Ive only had about - TC seizures and theyve all been while Im asleep
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,I wake up to that twitching feeling but within seconds I go into the seizure
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,I asked my doctor if the eye twitching is related to the seizures to which she seems to be full blown confident they arent
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,I only asked because I dont understand why I get that same feeling before a seizure
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,During the day I can get the eye twitching multiple times a day but Im in control of myself
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Other than people who might notice it and think Im winking at them
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Ive had a eeg that I took home and wore for a week and the eye twitching happened throughout the week but nothing showed up on the results
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,So maybe they arent
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,I also asked if they could be partial seizure but she also doubted that
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Basically saying if my eye twitching is constantly happening and I dont have a seizure she doesnt see how they could be related
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Its just confusing because she doesnt really seem too concerned
rk3i5e,t5_2s1h9,Im on medication to avoid the TC seizures at night but I dont understand why I would feel that weird eye twitching right before the TCs when I was having them
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,Sending my CFer to School This Fall Is anyone else sending their CFer to public school this fall
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,I feel strongly that there is more to life than CF and I dont want to bubble her
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,I see that she has fell behind a bit socially and developmentally during this past year of Covid isolation
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,The entire family is vaccinated
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,but she isnt yet due to not being old enough
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,I plan to vaccinate her as soon as I can
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,I am terrified with the Delta variant and hope I am making the right choice
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,My mother keeps pressuring me not to send her
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,but I cant just sit back and watch her fall behind any more
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,She is in a classroom of  kids and the teacher is fully vaccinated
oq3p4e,t5_2r876,Her CF doctor told me it is up to me
r06dr7,t5_2syer,Does a gout attack affect your EFR and creatinine numbers
r06dr7,t5_2syer,I had my first gout attack and the doc had me take a number of blood tests
r06dr7,t5_2syer,The results came back and my uric acid levels were fine but my creatinine and EFR both scored poorly
r06dr7,t5_2syer,I was sent to a kidney specialist but I cant get in for a couple more weeks
r06dr7,t5_2syer,I was told to get another test prior to my next appointment and my gout attack is almost gone
r06dr7,t5_2syer,Im just curious if anyone knows if a gout attack somehow makes your creatinine and EFR numbers bad
r06dr7,t5_2syer,And then once the attack is over those numbers could see improvement
r06dr7,t5_2syer,Thanks for any help you could give
r06dr7,t5_2syer,I appreciate it

ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,Every single time I wake up I wish I hadnt the pain and discomfort is constant with the only relief being sleep or sitting in a boiling hot bath for hours on end
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,I used to be a very active person
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,I loved running
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,hung out with friends daily
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,I was always out at car meets and campedhiked on weekends
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,I can no longer do any of those things
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,I feel like a shell of the person I used to be
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,Everything I used to take for granted is so hard for me to do now
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,As I mentioned above my symptoms have gotten more severe over time and slowly all of my friends have disappeared
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,I watched as my flare up days got closer and closer together until everyday was the same amount of pain no matter what I did or ate
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,Visits to the ER
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,dieticians and doctors got more frequent

ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,It is now the second time I am attempting to pass this course   semester long

ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,I am the star student of my class with perfect notes and put the most effort into my work as I possibly can it is my main source of entertainment yet after all the time Ive put in I am back where I started
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,This year I have been accommodated for much more and now I dont have to go into class often
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,although these accommodations are helpful the truth is that I cant last a day at TAFE so how am I supposed to hold down a job as a mechanic in the future

ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,this same story and there are so many shitty parts about having IBS that I havent even mentioned yet

ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,Ive attempted suicide many times before and obviously Im still here
ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,At this point all an attempt means is a trip to the psych ward so Ive stopped bothering

svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,How did you get diagnosed with IBS
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,I was wondering how the diagnosis for IBS was for some of you
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,When I went to my primary care doctor
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,she didnt really do much and did not want to send me to a gastroenterologist
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,My reported symptoms were bloating
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,and these have been persistent for over a year
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,She did take a blood test for any food allergies and after negative results
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,just deemed that I had IBS
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,She prescribed me Imodium and gasX which doesnt even help or address my issues
svlp4p,t5_2s3g1,Im still suffering really bad from the symptoms and am just curious if I should try to advocate more for myself since we didnt rule out any other problems or try to see any specialist

rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,Question regarding my brother Hello
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,I hope that my question is rightly placed here
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,My brother is okay now but I still think about his delusions and I dont know what form of mental health problem was involved there
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,A few years ago my brother got a new job after he was unemployed for around a year
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He quit his last job because the business did illegal stuff
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He was at the univeristy and I think it was stressful for him to be unemployed that long
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,I am way younger than him
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,When I was born he was a teenager
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,But when I grew older we did a lot of stuff together
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,We also both did drugs and while he was unemployed his drug use got more intense
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,We did everything from weed to psychedelics to stuff like opioids
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,This maybe contributed to his state at the time
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,When he started his new job he was excited but he soon started to worry
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He thought his drug use may could lead to him loosing his job
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,And soon he would think that the people at his job spy on him in order to get him into prison
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,In our country drug use is decriminalized and my brother knew that but he still thought that the police is working together with his colleagues to get him into prison
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He thought the people will record what he talks about to find something that will get him into prison
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He started to record his colleagues with his smartphone
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He listened to what they said and searched for prove that he was right
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,One time after work a colleague smoked a joint and asked him if he wants to join
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,My brother did smoke with him because he thought that this guy may be not part of the conspiracy against him
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,Later he thought that this guy was from the police and recorded him smoking weed
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He talked openly about this situation with our family
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,Most people told him that he was delusional but he would not listen
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,After a few months I got him to contact a therapist and this really helped him
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,Later he told me that this was not the first time he thought people planned a conspiracy against him
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,When I was  my friends often chilled at my parents house
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,My brother thought that we talk bad about him which we never did
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,One day he was drunk and me and some friends talked to him
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He suddenly went into rage mode and beat the shit out of me while my friends were hiding
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He told me that he thought that we were planning something against him
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,Does this sound like some form of reaccuring psychosis thing
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,Or like another mental health problem
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,He is good now and it does not seem like he experiences something like that now
rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,His therapist told him that his symptoms are normal but for me he seemed pretty delusional
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,Relief from keyboard pain Hi everyone
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,I wanted to share a feature in Windows  that has been a bit of a game changer for me
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,Windows made significant upgrades to their speech to text software which allows me to simply talk into my microphone instead of typing
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,To be clear
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,this was already a feature in Windows 
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,but it was pretty awful
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,its incredibly accurate and saves my hands a lot of pain
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,I teach a lot of online courses
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,so typing is a part of my life
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,My hands would throb at the end of the day
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,but that has significantly diminished because of this updated feature
snlq1r,t5_2rtve,I hope this helps
suytog,t5_2saq9,Feel I like I MUST drink water even though Im hydrated with POTS
suytog,t5_2saq9,I have POTS and possibly autoimmune issues but I am in the process of getting diagnosed
suytog,t5_2saq9,One problem I have been having is a strange physical need to drink water in a way I didnt experience before POTS
suytog,t5_2saq9,If I move around more than usual or get very emotional or just exist for a while my body will feel an overwhelming need to take a sip of water
suytog,t5_2saq9,If I dont drink water I feel terrible physically
suytog,t5_2saq9,Taking a sip of water helps abate the symptoms
suytog,t5_2saq9,The doctors I have spoken to think it could be a result of low blood volume causing my body to trigger my brain to tell me to intake fluids
suytog,t5_2saq9,I drink about 
suytog,t5_2saq9, liters of water a day and I cant do anything or go anywhere without water
suytog,t5_2saq9,Does anyone else experience this

rr2cgu,t5_2s1h9,Five years ago today was my last brain surgery

s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,Feelings of alternate personalities
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,Im very confused about this and have never been able to explain it very well
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I have a very negative part of me that will speak sometimes
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,It encourages me to hurt myself and puts me down constantly
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I can usually suppress it but whenever Im alone or stressed it starts to surface and become more prominent
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,Whenever its prevalent it will just rant about random things
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I can hear and process what its saying
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,but it takes me a second to put it back down
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I have gotten very good at keeping it down and its to the point that its almost impossible for me to bring out or consciously let it speak
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I just dont know if its an actual personality or if its something else
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I want to tell my therapist about it but most of the time I feel as if my thoughts are completely buried by another person coming forward to talk for me
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I feel very dissociated to the point where looking in the mirror and seeing myself is very eerie and unsettling
s1vkkh,t5_2tyg2,I want to know if anyone else knows what this is like and can give me some advice on what to do

sqixw8,t5_2s23e,Second MRI My doctor had told me a month or so ago that he was ordering my second MRI to be done with contrast
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,of head and neck
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,He prescribed me lorazepam to calm my nerves as Im horribly phobic of needles
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,I arrive today for the MRI
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,sedated and ready for this
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,the tech was rude
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,She told me that I was wrong
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,we werent doing my head and neck we were doing my whole body and I was going to be here for a few hours
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,no big deal
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,Im off for the weekend
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,I mentioned to her that I had taken lorazepam about  minutes prior to the appointment in preparation for the IV
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,And she laughed at me and said she wasnt giving me contrast
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,They dont do contrast at night
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,otherwise my appointment would have been in the morning
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,I am sure there had been a mix up and begged her to look at the referral again
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,At this point
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,Im already here
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,Lets just do it
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,I want to get it done and go home
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,She then tells me that I absolutely cannot keep my thin leggings or long sleeve shirt on because I will get too hot and its for my own comfort
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,I tried to tell her that I am uncomfortable wearing the hospital gown and Ive had MRIs before for other issues and have always been allowed to keep my clothing on and I am typically cold
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,She still refused
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,I laid there in the dang rave tunnel for  hours frozen
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,I couldnt even keep my socks on
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,My poor boyfriend picked up a very cranky and sleepy girlfriend from her appointment tonight  Im sure my doctor will have the results on Monday
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,Im not sure how theyll be any different than the first MRI he did a month ago
sqixw8,t5_2s23e,Regardless Ill be asking for a referral to a neurologist

rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,Father with Epilepsy and on-set dementia and on three medications every  hours
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,for over  years
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,Was hoping to reach out here and see if anyone can provide assistance for my father   He is  years old  and has been epileptic since age  due to traumatic brain injury
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,He has been on seizure medication ever since which now include Keppra
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,and Depakote he takes about mg every  hours am and pm
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,This short term memory is completely gone doesnt remember when I am home
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,where he has been
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,what city he lives in
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,It seems like his petite seizures have increased without change in medication they cant give him anymore
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,he is maxed out
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,When he goes into this petite seizure
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,its like a form of dementia
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,but he will get stiff
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,shakes in his right hand
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,and he isnt coming out of them like he used to
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,As of today
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,he has refused to take his medication because he is being very combative
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,He tried biting himself
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,he is lashing out at my husband
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,my mother and I
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,He doesnt make sense
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,keeps repeating the words yes no its ok but it is slurred
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,almost like a stroke
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,The episode started around pm last night and as of now am PST the next day
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,he is asleep
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,but urinated in the laundry room thinking he was in the bathroom
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,I am still unable to get him to take his medication and he is still in the hazy state of seizing
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,It is possible that he is continuing to have multiple petite seizures due to not taking his meds he needs his meds or will seize within hours he has NOT had a grand mal seizure as of yet
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,but I would assume that is coming given he has been without medication for over hrs
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,  The doctors have no answers and I am running out of options on how he needs to be treated
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,Not everyday is bad
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,but the petite seizuredementia has been occurring at least every - months
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,Usually seizures decrease with age
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,but he is doing the opposite
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,long term care assistance is appreciated
rw2glq,t5_2s1h9,I just dont know where to turn anymore
q96mdy,t5_2syer,Allo is a life changer
q96mdy,t5_2syer,I started Allo around 
q96mdy,t5_2syer, months ago now
q96mdy,t5_2syer,originally I was sceptical as at  years old I hated the idea of taking a pill every day for the rest of my life
q96mdy,t5_2syer,I started on mg but was still getting flares that were stopped dead by the colchicine
q96mdy,t5_2syer,After my blood test a month later I insisted I up my dose as my UI Serum level was still at 
q96mdy,t5_2syer,Since moving to mg Ive had no twinges
q96mdy,t5_2syer,Ive eaten brisket and drank IPAs my  biggest triggers and had zero reaction
q96mdy,t5_2syer,For anyone who is doubting Allo

sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,afraid im I on the verge of psychosis I genuinely dont know if my anxious thoughts got very bad or traumatic events are making me more on edge
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,so im just looking for advice on if I should address this to my therapist
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,But recently some stuff happened that made my delusions much much worse
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,Usually its just things like oh I cant leave my house or they will see me but tomorrow is safer so I can or that item I just bought is watching me i have to throw it in a closet or that item will bring bad things i cant touch it but now its become hearing things scream my name very frequently ive had this in the past but its usually just a few times a week not constantly and I think people are constantly talking about me and watching
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,this had gotten so bad to the point im too scared to go to the store and im worried it will start to make me too scared to go to work
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,At work im convinced a demon is trying to get me and I hear them talking or knocking so I refuse to be in a room alone at all and that seems to help kinda cause nothing can hurt me if im not alone
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,This is causing a lot of stress on me to the point ive scratched all the skin around my fingers off and its very painful
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,I am so worried that this could be the beginning of psychosis or im just being over dramatic because these things come in waves then get easier to manage again
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,Like there have been times where i cut off all my tastebuds every day for protection but then a few weeks later the need is gone so I dont tell my therapist half of it
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,But should I
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,can she know that I know something isnt right
sbdezn,t5_2tyg2,I am worried I will say too much and end up getting sent to the hospital or its absolutely nothing and ill look like an idiot for even asking
rzfgja,t5_2qlaa,Just a quick question   How do you feel when youre bloated

rzfgja,t5_2qlaa,I feel more heaviness towards one side of my abdomen
rzfgja,t5_2qlaa,cramping when I pee or move
rzfgja,t5_2qlaa,In the past Ive gone to the ER and had scans done to rule our appendicitis or ovarian cysts or the like
rzfgja,t5_2qlaa,So I know with confidence is not either of those
rzfgja,t5_2qlaa,Im just curious if others experience similar bloating symptoms or how does it feel for you

q4473a,t5_2r876,CF carrier here and very confused Hello friends
q4473a,t5_2r876,I am newly pregnant and decided to do some gene testing
q4473a,t5_2r876,My test came back with a CF carrier gene TCLP
q4473a,t5_2r876,I am completely new to this and dont know how to properly abbreviate this
q4473a,t5_2r876,From everything I have researched
q4473a,t5_2r876,this is a rare mutation and specific to a region that I am from could be wrong
q4473a,t5_2r876,but there is just not a lot of info I found on this mutation
q4473a,t5_2r876,My mind is just blown and I had no idea I was a carrier
q4473a,t5_2r876,No one in my family from either parents had CF
q4473a,t5_2r876,At least none that Ive ever heard of
q4473a,t5_2r876,I didnt even know about CF until about  years ago
q4473a,t5_2r876,After doing a deep dive on Google which is awful at anytime
q4473a,t5_2r876,but especially when you are pregnant I found that  in  caucasians are a carrier for a CF mutation
q4473a,t5_2r876,My husband is going to get tested to see if he is a carrier and then go from there
q4473a,t5_2r876,I am trying to stay positive
q4473a,t5_2r876,but its been hard
q4473a,t5_2r876,I read some studies that even carriers can have certain symptoms and it just makes so much sense to me now
q4473a,t5_2r876,My mind is blown because how is it possible that this disease is so rare
q4473a,t5_2r876,but there are SO many carriers out there
svrtja,t5_2saq9,F Im wanting to go to the doctors about symptoms Ive been having for the past year which very much align with pots or dysautonomia in general like discoloured legs Ive had this in the shower for as long as i can remember but now Im getting it just by standing for too long
svrtja,t5_2saq9,shower or not
svrtja,t5_2saq9,dizziness when standing  in the shower all worse when I havent eaten etc etc
svrtja,t5_2saq9,Im quite stressed about going to the doctors though cause Im scared theyll be quite happy to dismiss me and Im also wondering whether these symptoms would all be happening at the same time like an episode of sorts or if they can happen on their own because I can have them together but also randomly on their own
svrtja,t5_2saq9,Any advice for me at this stage would be great

rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,Lacosamide makes me tired and nauseous and definitely doesnt help the anxiety and depression
rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,but Ive been trying to push through and make it work because I dont want to switch again
rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,the whole concept is kind of scary

rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,I dont know that Im ready for it
rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,but Im ready to at least try

rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,but Im feeling generally confident about it and I hope I get it
rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,Im just nervous about being able to actually perform with how lethargic I feel all the time and the nausea
rhsa0k,t5_2s1h9,but I cant succeed if I dont try

smnmju,t5_2s3g1,I tend not to eat anything during the mornings until about pm  Ive been more stressed out recently my Nan died a couple of weeks ago and I have a lot of things on my plate rn  so Im assuming stress is exacerbating my IBS symptoms
smnmju,t5_2s3g1,Ive also not been sleeping too well lately

rqltfb,t5_2r876,Medicaid  Marriage I was posting to see if anyone can offer some insight into this
rqltfb,t5_2r876,So I currently work full time in the state of North Carolina
rqltfb,t5_2r876,I was born with CF and still retain Aetna and medicaid as my insurers with no out of pocket cost for basically anything
rqltfb,t5_2r876,Im still unclear on whether or not the state salary  earnings cap applies to someone in my condition born with a chronic illness and cant ever  get someone on the phone with medicaid that knows anything or can offer insight
rqltfb,t5_2r876,However me and my fiance are planning to get married
rqltfb,t5_2r876,whether it be in our hearts or the governments eyes
rqltfb,t5_2r876,Because if their is any chance getting married could cause me to lose medicaid
rqltfb,t5_2r876,it is simply not an option due to cost
rqltfb,t5_2r876,Can anyone offer advice or solid factual info on this matter
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,Clarification on POTS symptom I see a lot of people saying they have pots because their HR increases like bpm when standing up from lying down
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,Mine does that
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,its always done that my entire life
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,However seconds after I stand up I can watch my heart rate drop back down
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,Im under the impression a symptom of POTS is a heart rate  that increases like bpm when standing but also remains high for more than  minutes along with other symptoms such as light headedness
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,Can someone clarify that
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,laying down resting Ill be -bpm
s5rx0g,t5_2saq9,If I stand up it might jump to -bpm for a few seconds and then drop back down into the  range

rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,My experiences with long standing LERD and advice from the community Hello everyone
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,Ive been having long standing LERD from the last  years
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,I was first diagnosed with GERD
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,but as my symptoms progressed
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,it was then changed to LERD
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,My symptoms have usually been coming on and off and they have been doing so over the last several years
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,The longest Ive been free from symptoms has been  months which was years ago but the symptoms always come back
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,when the disease started
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,it started with a feeling of a lump in my throat that wouldnt go even if I cleared my throat
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,That feeling persisted for days at time
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,After my diagnosis I was put on PPIs Omiprazole and that didnt really help
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,But with time
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,that feeling of a lump in the throat disappeared
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,This feeling of a lump in the throat kept coming back and disappearing a few times over the years
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,However
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,off late the lumpy feeling has disappeared in favor of chronic cough and throat clearing
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,I literally start coughing very badly after eating anything and also a few minutes after I wake up in the morning
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,I have a  min long cough with wheezing
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,Its bad enough
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,I do have a bit of abdominal pain
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,but nothing too serious
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,Ive tried a lot of the advice from the internet such as    Raising my head while sleeping  Eating smaller
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,more frequent meals  Sleeping on the left side at night  Apple cider vinegar with water  None of that has helped
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,My cough is the same
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,I also am on PPIs Omiprazole
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,Again that is not helping
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,There is no trigger food as such that I have been able to identify
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,I just start coughing after eatingdrinking anything
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,with the exception of water
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,Most of the cough is wet with a good amount of wheezing in between as the cough gets worse over time
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,I usually need  to spit out the excess saliva
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,The symptoms sometimes get better once the saliva gets cleared from the throat
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,but sometimes not
rsl8lo,t5_2qlaa,How would you guys advice I approach these symptoms
qakm65,t5_2r876,post Kaftrio Hello everyone
qakm65,t5_2r876,My son has been on Kaftrio for the last  months
qakm65,t5_2r876,His weight is slowly moving up and his FEV is now constantly in the - area this is all fantastic
qakm65,t5_2r876,Every  days or so he really complains that his nose feels super itchy
qakm65,t5_2r876,He doesnt have any mucus to blow out and he seems to want to snort to try to make it stop hurting
qakm65,t5_2r876,I try to get him to blow it
qakm65,t5_2r876,but that doesnt produce anything
qakm65,t5_2r876,Obviously Im thinking sinus
qakm65,t5_2r876,but has anyone had this feeling
qakm65,t5_2r876,Could this be a Kaftrio side-effect
qakm65,t5_2r876,Seems odd that it comes and goes
qakm65,t5_2r876,We thought it was due to chlorine in the swimming pool
qakm65,t5_2r876,but he hasnt been swimming for  weeks now
qakm65,t5_2r876,Not looking for diagnosis etc
qakm65,t5_2r876,but Id like to have a bit of anecdotal before we discuss with his team at his next face-to-face
qakm65,t5_2r876,Thanks for any thoughts
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,Throat inflammation Im  and developed symptoms of GERD in May after a week of overeating before bed
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,would workout regularly
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,no health issues
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,Symptoms have subsided for the most part with lansoprazole mg
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,Ive now weaned down to mg
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,Id get acid reflux in the throat
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,upper abdomen pain
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,One of the symptoms I still have is throat pain
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,It sometimes feels tightirritated and also it feels physically tender to touch and painful at times
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,I dont believe I get reflux anymore because I no longer experience any burning like I used to
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,never any sour taste on tongue etc
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,but my throat just feels inflamed sometimes and my neck physically feels tenderas if its hurt on the inside almost
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,But then other times its completely normal to touch and doesnt feel inflamed at all
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,Is this normal or does anyone have an explanation for this
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,This is one of my last symptoms apart from upper abdomen stinging sometimes but infrequently
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,Also just wanted to add doctor did not advise for me to have an endoscopy at the time because h said he thought it wasnt necessary
rt1jmg,t5_2qlaa,Advice would be appreciated thanks
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,I feel like Im faking all of my symptoms even though I know I have them
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,Like I constantly feel like Im exaggerating and manipulating the doctors even though I know Im suffering
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,Im like excited to get a diagnosis because I know Ill get treatment and Ill be validated but it almost feels like Im making all this up
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,Ive convinced myself that every symptom I have is just made up and Im faking everything and Im a terrible person and I dont know how to deal with
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,Ive learned to accept it and Express myself i love making and looking at art that expresses it and it makes me think you just think psychosis is cool when I KNOW i spend days thinking im a demon and Im not making that up
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,How do I stop thinking like this
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,Im genuinely suffering but I convince myself Im not because I dont believe I could be aware of it if it was real
su6ros,t5_2tyg2,Im sorry I feel like I should apologize for it I feel like Im not psychotic enough like I feel like i shouldnt get the treatment because other people have it worse

qu1l3m,t5_2r876,How long after your first dose of Trikafta did your purge start
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,See title   Basically Ive started a new job and subsequently got Trikafta
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,I was hoping to do things the other way around
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,but thats not how it worked out
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,Im trying to avoid having to take any time off to deal with the infamous purge if possible
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,So I was wondering how long it took from your first dose until you started to feel a little rough around the edges if at all
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,I was wondering if I could time the first dose to be late Friday morning
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,so by the time I might be feeling rough it would be the end of the work day and then Id have all weekend to deal with symptoms and see how I feel Monday
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,Company seems super great
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,and Im sure they would give me the time off if needed they know about my CF
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,and know I am getting this new miracle drug
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,but I literally just started last Monday and dont want to have to make that request
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,At the same time
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,I want to be putting my best foot forward while Im actually on the job so dont want to be purging while I need to be focusing on work
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,So how long did your purge last
qu1l3m,t5_2r876,and how long after your first dose did you begin to feel it

subf3c,t5_2tyg2,after a month of quitting
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,things were quite bad  i had very high anxiety
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,One night I decided to smoke a joint with my mates
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,i suddenly started to feel like everyone in the room are looking at me and talking about me my best mates started to feel like enemies to me
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,like they were judging me for no reason i got extremely paranoid and went to the other room trying to calm my brain down with the racing thoughts
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,I felt like my brain would explode with the thoughts
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,I was never the same after that incident
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,i was extremely quite and anhedonic with  racing thoughts
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,So can it be a psychosis episode or just a bad anxiety attack
subf3c,t5_2tyg2,Havent had that again in  years but im still anhedonic

rwdrv0,t5_2s1h9,I recently had found out that mouth guard are likely beneficial for those of us who bite their tongue but Im curious what are some things we could possibly do to also help with backshoulder pain
rwdrv0,t5_2s1h9,Also  I started having seizures since  and nearly all of them have been in my sleep
rwdrv0,t5_2s1h9,Ive done CAT Scan
rwdrv0,t5_2s1h9,Ive got my body checked multiple times and I always have received positive results and my doctors mentioning that Im good but these usually end up coming back and affecting me in my sleep again

rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,how important is it to continue getting tested if ive found a medication that works
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,my neurologist suggested that
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,since my medication works
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,i can hold off on a three day EEG
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,we havent found out if my episodes are epileptic or psychogenic
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,nor do we know what regions of the brain are affected or where they start in
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,my neurologist strays away from calling them seizures since my  minute EEG was normal as was everything else  because he hasnt witnessed one
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,i agreed to try medication while waiting for testing
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,and i tried keppra with some results
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,though not enough to continue
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,im on vimpat mg twice a day and it has drastically increased my quality of life
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,many of the issues i suffered from deja vu
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,chronic fatigue have almost entirely gone away
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,i feel alive and functional
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,i suppose it could be placebo
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,but im not convinced since i assumed i had PNES
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,which cant be treated with anticonvulsants
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,im thinking of calling off the three day EEG for now
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,unless something serious happens in the near future
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,whats the outlook here
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,what are the benefits of me continuing the testingdiagnostic process if ive found something that works
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,epilepsy if thats what i have is lifelong
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,but is it better to get everything sorted out ASAP
rpdc3m,t5_2s1h9,or wait while i still can
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,Psychotic episode because of trauma
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,today I had a really interesting session with my therapist
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,Ive ben having a psychotic break for almost over a month
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,I didnt understand why and that scared me because I have a habit of always trying to find out reasons for everything
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,I told me therapist how I feel and what was happening and she asked me if anything happened before I started to have my psychotic break
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,I stopped and thought for a couple of minutes and then I remembered that I had a really bad fight with my girlfriend where she told me a lot of things that hurt me
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,As soon as she started to tell me those things I started having flashbacks of a lot of traumas
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,When the situation calmed down my girlfriend actually came up to me and had a Serious talk where she told me that she was sorry
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,she didnt mean to tell me those things and she never meant to hurt me
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,After a couple of hours I started dissociating
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,I continued having more flashbacks of my trauma
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,I was feeling nothing
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,I went to sleep and the next day I started to having a psychotic break
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,I dont remember a lot of these last weeks
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,but what I know is that it wasnt my girlfriends fault and I cant control my triggers
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,Now I dont know anything of what is happening
sjoo91,t5_2tyg2,having a lot of hallucinations and delusions

rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Been reading on here a lot and on the hiatial hernia side of reddit
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,no positive outlooks whatsoever it seems
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Conflicting notes abt the HH
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Most say its a non issue if its small and apparently cm is small
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Others say its the worst hell of their life and I think Im a believer in that right now bc everything sucks
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Gerds been an issue for maybe a year or two now but never to this extent
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Had extreme extreme stress around Sept  Oct that presumably kicked this all off
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,I dont know
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,I cant manage my anxiety bc I cant eat and I cant sleep
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,My heart is pounding a mile a minute almost daily
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,especially at night
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Likely bc Im so low on electrolytes
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,I manage to sleep a few hours a night but seem to wake up hourly after trying to sleep
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,I just started zoloft so maybe thats contributing
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,I dont know
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,It all seems scary and like it will never end
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,I feel like Im dying and no doctor cares
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,My own doctor just thinks Im an anxious mess
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,and I AM
rnve1g,t5_2qlaa,Feels like no end in sight and when I read this subreddit

rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,How can I get a full-time job if I have GERD
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,which forces me to spend  hours a day eating
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Im a young guy with no work experience whos looking for a job
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Ive done one year of college and am currently taking a gap year
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,But over the last several months
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Ive developed Gastroesophageal reflux diseasehttpswww
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,which forces me to spend  hours a day eating and drinking
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,If I try to do so any faster
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,I literally get too bloated to continue
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,With this in mind
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,I was wondering how I should go about getting a full-time job
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,I tried to research this question online
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,but despite the fact that many people have GERD
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,I somehow cant find any good answers
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,despite this burden
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Im capable of working a part-time job and still being able to eat before and after it
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,But I worry that with a full-time job
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,I literally wont have the time to get enough Calories and water every day
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,I plan to snack whenever I can throughout the workday
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,but Ill probably only be able to find so much time
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,I think its a bad idea to try to eat while Im working
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,as distracted eating only makes my GERD symptoms worse
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Should I only apply to full-time jobs if I know they provide a flexible schedule beforehand
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Or should I try applying to standard full-time jobs
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,then mention my condition during the interviewafter Im hired to see if the employer can make accommodations
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Or should I only apply to part-time jobs until I get my condition under control who knows how long thatll take
rw7j4j,t5_2qlaa,Thank you for any help
rn3jqj,t5_2r876,CF and COVID Hey yall I had a question
rn3jqj,t5_2r876,Since we are high risk for COVID
rn3jqj,t5_2r876,I was wondering if anyone has gotten it and what was your experience
rn3jqj,t5_2r876,I know the CF Foundation in the US posted some positive data about it in the beginning
rn3jqj,t5_2r876,but I havent seen anything since
rn3jqj,t5_2r876,  This is not meant to be political
rn3jqj,t5_2r876,I thought i had it last week and it just got me thinking
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Being sent to a neurologist to check for MS
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,How do I best handle this appointment
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,How do I know if this is a good doctor
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,What do I need to know before I meet this doctor
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I have a lot of doctor baggage from years of feeling awful
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,but my bloodwork etc is always fine and therefore Im always fine
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Here is a quick summary of what Ive been through  Started having extreme fatigue
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Checked thyroid over and over
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Always good along with everything else
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,-Had an episode where I nearly fainted
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Was bed ridden for weeks
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,My head felt like it was buzzing
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I only felt relief from laying down
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I felt spaced out and exhausted
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,This exhaustion is like nothing I can describe
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Its like its too much work to even breathe
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,When the buzzing subsidedI had a tremor in my hand
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,even my voice
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Went to a neurologist who told me that my tremor wasnt too bad
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,and just to come back if it got worse
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,-Fast forward a couple years
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,the tremor very slowly stopped except on the worst days
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I was driving home and suddenly couldnt talk properly
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,It felt like I had to push the words out of myself with extreme effort
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I was sent to the ER where they checked me and ran a stroke protocol
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I learned I had white matter on my brain that could be MS or could be from migraines
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I was sent to another neurologist
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,which I couldnt see for months bc of the waitlist so thankfully I was feeling some better then
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,He told me from the MRI he didnt think it was MS
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,and that he could do a lumbar puncture
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,but since I was feeling better
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,the results would not be accurate
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,So I opted out of that
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,and just kept plugging along
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,At this time
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I also had read about MS and even though I thought anything was possible
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,MS as I read it
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,just didnt seem to fit
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,-From then on throughout the last couple years
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I often have weird vision disturbances
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Bouts of extreme fatigue
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,If I over do itI have severe left side pain
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Which has been check via ultrasound and CT
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Facial numbness on the top half of my face this is new
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I space out
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Cant find certain words
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,even when not eatingdrinking
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,My left pinky also has become curled
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Just WEIRDstressful things
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I went back to my GP and just laid it all out
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,He says he believes its a real possibility that its MS and here I am being sent to another neurologist the former one retired
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I did not mention MSthis is what he said after listening to my symptoms and look at the MRI from the ER visit   I just want this appointment to give answers
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,whether its MS or not
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,I have done this over and over
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Please give me the tools I need to have a successful appointment with answers
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,Im afraid of what the next few year will be like
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,bc each episode seems to be getting worse and having crazier after effects
sthwb4,t5_2s23e,If you made it this farTHANK YOU

rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,tldr wondering if I have reflux esophagitis and if it can be self-treatedhow to do so
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I dont have GERD
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and I go weeks at a time without reflux
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,This is a very long post that covers a few days of symptoms
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,so I apologize in advanced
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,This all started during a New Years party
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and a lot of potential triggers or events occured
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I ate a TON of food
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,My eyes got itchy and I felt a bit allergic at one point
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and soon got a headache
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I then took a couple advils for the headache
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,felt better and ate more
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and then drank alcohol right before bed Yes
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I know that was a bad idea
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I could feel the fire in my chest when I was going to sleep
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,but it didnt hurt too bad when I laid down so I ignored it
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I woke up New Years Day
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and I knew something was up because I was constantly burping
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I could not eat anything without feeling a burning in my esophagus
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I was having this reflux-type burning pain
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and various other chest pains
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I was also nauseous but only when food was in my mouth
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,The nausea would immediately go away otherwise
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,No stomach pain of any kind
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,Burning pain in chest was maybe 
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,By next day
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,after having eaten VERY little calories my appetite was very much gone
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and food still made me nauseous
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I was still burping a little
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I ate only mashed potatoes and some plain pasta
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,kept everything soft
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and chewed a lot
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,Barely felt any burning
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,and when I did
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,it was maybe a 
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I dont know how it got better so fast
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,but I am now TERRIFIED to eat because I dont know what the heck caused this awful episode
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,I did some research and landed on Reflux esophagitis
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,Esophagitis seemingly has a few types
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,but I dont think I have the NSAIDpill burning version
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,or the bacteria-based version
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,Can you get esophagitis from one evening of ignoring refluxacid
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,Is it something else
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,No stomach pain or nausea during any of this
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,but my esophagus burning has gone from that  down to a 
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,so seemingly Im improving
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,Is this something that will likely resolve on its own
rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,Any advice or experience is appreciated
sekgv2,t5_2syer,Help me understand flareup English is not my st language
sekgv2,t5_2syer,so just want to be sure I understand the term correctly
sekgv2,t5_2syer,Can flare up happen just by ingesting a small portion of prawns or does it require purine build up
sekgv2,t5_2syer,My symptoms were similar to carpel tunnel
sekgv2,t5_2syer,but doctor suspects uric acid and I was under medication until yesterday
sekgv2,t5_2syer,I have been careful about my diet but yesterday I had a small piece of prawn and today
sekgv2,t5_2syer,I felt a slight pain in my elbow
sekgv2,t5_2syer,I have an appointment with doctor next week and will check with him
sekgv2,t5_2syer,but just thought I will ask here
swus98,t5_2s3g1,What vitamins are essential for ibs especially with constipation
swehfr,t5_2saq9,How to sit at a desk for longer periods of time
swehfr,t5_2saq9,It seems every time I sit down at a desk I get a headache and can only be on the computer for about  mins
swehfr,t5_2saq9,It seems to use more energy than walking I wonder why and if theres any other alternative way to sit and use my computer
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Spoilers ahead I watched last weeks episode of The Resident and I have feelings So for those of you who watch the TV show The Resident
sox88m,t5_2s23e,you likely noticed a lot of what I noticed this past week
sox88m,t5_2s23e,I have such mixed feelings about how they portrayed the diagnosis and I just needed to vent them to people who will understand
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Background One of the doctors has been having some symptoms in his hand recently and covertly had one of his colleagues run tests
sox88m,t5_2s23e,He just found out it is MS
sox88m,t5_2s23e,the doctor receiving the diagnosis
sox88m,t5_2s23e,is an older surgeon
sox88m,t5_2s23e,On the good side
sox88m,t5_2s23e,I appreciated that they accurately represented the emotional fallout from diagnosis that I know I dealt with and see many others in here deal with shortly after finding out
sox88m,t5_2s23e,He lashed out a bit and made the rash decision to quit practicing medicine because theres no point any more
sox88m,t5_2s23e,He threw himself a pity party that I know all too well and I respect that they did show this
sox88m,t5_2s23e,On the bad side though
sox88m,t5_2s23e,This is a medical drama and his character is a well respected senior level doctor
sox88m,t5_2s23e,I feel like the writers had a responsibility to research MS better and give Dr
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Bell both experiences and dialog that is medically accurate
sox88m,t5_2s23e,The biggest things that stood out to me revolved around his optic neuritis
sox88m,t5_2s23e,He had exactly one moment of optic neuritis and it lasted approximately  minutes
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Now I could be wrong
sox88m,t5_2s23e,but does that sound right to any of you guys
sox88m,t5_2s23e,he stated that because he had that one single event of optic neuritis
sox88m,t5_2s23e,that alone was evidence that he had an aggressive case and that was his justification for quitting
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Now I do agree that someone with active flares
sox88m,t5_2s23e,or someone who hasnt recovered from a flare should not be performing surgery
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Theres no question is unethical to cut if you cant control your fine motor skills or see at that point in time
sox88m,t5_2s23e,But thats not the angle he was taking and I was just frankly disappointed
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Has anyone else watched the show
sox88m,t5_2s23e,What are your thoughts
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Did you have a completely different take on the episode
sox88m,t5_2s23e,Ive loved this show from the start and now I just dont know what to feel about this new story arc
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,Organs or blood worth donating
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,I was diagnosed in  when I was 
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,I have a RRMS relapsing-remitting form of MS
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,I am curious about being an organ donor
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,Or even donating blood or plasma
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,I have assumed without educating myself that since my diagnosis my body is tainted and wouldnt be any good for any form of donation
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,I know MS is a neurological disease and not transferable like a cold or STD would
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,Am I wrong to think like this
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,Any medical study any personal experience out there
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,This just may be a depressing thought of unworthiness associated with my condition
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,Any and all feedback is appreciated
s1bzyk,t5_2s23e,Bless you all 
owahcy,t5_2r876,my clinic are super stumped by some strange issues Ive got going on and have resorted to shoulder-shrugging
owahcy,t5_2r876,Im hoping one of you guys has some insight
owahcy,t5_2r876,In January I was taken off of Itraconizole
owahcy,t5_2r876,Id had a few runs of fungal plugs
owahcy,t5_2r876,but my Aspergillus ige was too low to justify my staying on it
owahcy,t5_2r876,Immediately after finishing it my health drop off
owahcy,t5_2r876,My lungs feel moderately clear been on Ivacaftor since 
owahcy,t5_2r876,but some tightness and increased sputum
owahcy,t5_2r876,The main symptom was dizziness
owahcy,t5_2r876,and general feeling of malaise
owahcy,t5_2r876,Id become dizzy when I stood up and would sometimes find myself having to grip walls or doors when feeling like I might lose consciousness never did fully
owahcy,t5_2r876,but fell into a few walls
owahcy,t5_2r876,I started TrikaftaKaftrio during this period
owahcy,t5_2r876,but it didnt help
owahcy,t5_2r876,A few weeks ago I did a fortnight stint in the ward on Meropenem  Tobramycin
owahcy,t5_2r876,with Aminophylline overnight
owahcy,t5_2r876,No change whatsoever until my last dose of Meropenem when I felt a strange burning sensation just over my upper abdomen on the right near bottom of rib cage
owahcy,t5_2r876,It lasted a couple of minutes then went away
owahcy,t5_2r876,Shortly after I had a burning pain in my right shoulder which stuck around for like - hours
owahcy,t5_2r876,ECG and BP fine
owahcy,t5_2r876,Shoulder pain was quite bad
owahcy,t5_2r876,It came and went over the next week
owahcy,t5_2r876,then on day  it came back big
owahcy,t5_2r876, pain for hours
owahcy,t5_2r876,Prior to this I was still experiencing the malaise
owahcy,t5_2r876,then the day after this bad pain my dizziness disappeared completely
owahcy,t5_2r876,One thing to add
owahcy,t5_2r876,after the bouts of pain my urine had a strange sickly sweet smell
owahcy,t5_2r876,My Drs have no clue whatsoever as to what happened
owahcy,t5_2r876,Ive been under investigation for heart issues and had CTs and a Echocardiogram
owahcy,t5_2r876,but nothing came back
owahcy,t5_2r876,My heart rate is higher than its ever been resting gone to mid-s from late-s for last few months Fitbit
owahcy,t5_2r876,but they dont seem concerned
owahcy,t5_2r876,Bloods dont show anything irregular
owahcy,t5_2r876,Theyre disregarding the upper abdomen pain as a red-herring
owahcy,t5_2r876,but thats seems strange to me as theyre clearly linked
owahcy,t5_2r876,Anyone had anything similar
owahcy,t5_2r876,Im in clinic later today
owahcy,t5_2r876,so anything to take in with me to suggest would be great

ruslw6,t5_2s1h9,Shes concerned that this sleep will screw up her breastfeeding schedule and she wont produce as much milk as she can be
ruslw6,t5_2s1h9,She feeds directly and pumps when she can during the day so I have breastmilk to feed our son overnight
ruslw6,t5_2s1h9,In order to get  hours of sleep she goes to bed and sets an alarm for  hours  from when she gets in bed as she never falls asleep right away
ruslw6,t5_2s1h9,She has a lactation consultant but she doesnt have any advice specific for someone with epilepsy and her neurologist doesnt have much advice about breastfeeding
ruslw6,t5_2s1h9,Anyone here have any tips or advice
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Attention problems Just got in a little argument and make up with my SO because of a common problem
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Its more noticeable to me I think 
suhdzo,t5_2s23e, but if Im typing
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,thinking about something or doing anything requiring attention its like Im not processing other information
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,So someone will ask me a question and have to repeat it he said x   I can hear talking but its like a delay or something and then I forget
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,To others it seems like Im just ignoring
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,To me it feels like I forget things so quickly or just dont process the words
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,I am  and it didnt use to be like this
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Id be able to write and take notes based on what I heard and so this seems so odd
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Im not sure how common it is for people get ADD onset at age 
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Anyway my SO got mad at me
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,which I understand
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,as this seems to happen a lot
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Just needed an outlet
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Any mental exercises to help divide attention or redirect attention
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,I think subconsciously I want to finish my thought or task Im not OR I want to redirect but then I feel overwhelmed and think something is wrong with me
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Doesnt feel good
suhdzo,t5_2s23e,Can anyone identify
sgzx19,t5_2s23e,Waiting on definitive diagnosis
sgzx19,t5_2s23e,How do you stop gaslighting yourself
sgzx19,t5_2s23e,so Im not going to detail my situation
sgzx19,t5_2s23e,What Id really like to know
sgzx19,t5_2s23e,for those comfortable sharing
sgzx19,t5_2s23e,is if you had a period of time prior to your diagnosis where you tried to talk yourself out of your symptoms
sgzx19,t5_2s23e,How did you eventually accept that you were in fact not being dramatic and that all of the things you were experiencing were legitimate
sjcfs2,t5_2saq9,What is the best heart rate tracker for Apple Watch
rit5w9,t5_2qlaa,What do I do when PPIs arent helping
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,Liquid IV and Hydration Drinks and Med Interactions Im not sure if anyone else on here has POTS and ADHD like I do but if you do heed my warning
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,For the past two weeks I have been taking my Adderall as normal
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,which if anything I should have been feeling its effects more since I hadnt taken it all winter break
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,I was freaking out slightly because I was doing super well on my dose and I didnt want to have to approach my doctor and be like I feel nothing anymore COME TO FIND OUT vitamin C cancels out adderall
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,I had been taking my meds every morning with a class of Liquid IV which is like  of your daily vitamin c in one stick
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,NO WONDER MY MEDS WERENT WORKING
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,TLDR Liquid IV and other hydration drinks are packed with vitamin C which prevents your body from absorbing the Adderall properly
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,so dont make the mistake I made and combine the two
s4dqzl,t5_2saq9,This probably goes for a lot of other medications

pbz6r7,t5_2syer,tips for getting a doctor to take you seriously
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,Ill keep this short
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,Im in my thirties and Im convinced I have gout
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,Ive been to a podiatrist about the foot pain in my toe joint and he all but diagnosed me there
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,we both agreed it sounded like gout
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,they dont prescribe medication
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,so I need to go to either a general practitioner or a rheumatologist to get the confirmation and Allo to treat it
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,the issue is that right now Im not having an attack
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,I just got over it less than a month ago
pbz6r7,t5_2syer,Ive heard horror stories about people my age not getting taken seriously and having trouble getting diagnosed and prescribed the meds to make this become manageable

st01vz,t5_2syer,My experience with Allupurinol am I the odd one out
st01vz,t5_2syer, so I was having pretty frequent attacks
st01vz,t5_2syer,Definitely a combination of genetics
st01vz,t5_2syer,lack of exercise and poor diet
st01vz,t5_2syer,But then I stopped all of that and was still extremely sensitive to attacks e
st01vz,t5_2syer,I could eat one rich meal
st01vz,t5_2syer,and be in pain in the same night
st01vz,t5_2syer,Went to the doctor and said I can take allopurinol and so I did for about - months
st01vz,t5_2syer,During the course the attacks pretty much were almost as frequent which apparently is to be expected but they continued well into the second month
st01vz,t5_2syer,I tried my best to exercise as much as I could during this period averaged at least  swims a week and later jogged - times a week
st01vz,t5_2syer,and now that the course is over I seem to be cured
st01vz,t5_2syer,Ive not had an attack since I stopped taking Allo
st01vz,t5_2syer,which was around mid-December
st01vz,t5_2syer,but also Ive been mostly good with diet
st01vz,t5_2syer,avoiding high protein  meat-heavy meals
st01vz,t5_2syer,Ive not kept up with the exercises as much
st01vz,t5_2syer,so Im just surprised that the attacks stopped soon as I stopped taking allo thats all
st01vz,t5_2syer,and wanted to see if others have similar experience
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,First seizure at work
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I dont know what to do next I started a new job about  months ago
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,At the time I not only didnt feel the need to tell them about my epilepsy
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,but I generally dont really like talking about it to most people
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,My family and boyfriend were upset with me about this because
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,for safety reasons
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,they felt like they should know
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,This is understandable to me however I hadnt had any seizure activity in about  months prior to this I was waiting to get it under control with new meds to look for a new job
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,Today was the first focal aware seizure Ive had in awhile I havent had a grand mal in about a year
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,For obvious reasons
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I was terrified
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,but also because no one at my job knows about my epilepsy
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,not even my boss
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I just kind of got up and walked out
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I wanted to get home before things got worse and before I possibly had more and was unable to drive myself home yes
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,dont even come for me I drove myself home
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I dont know what to do going forward
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,When I got home I texted my boss and told her I had a personal emergency and I was sorry I left without giving her a warning
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I think I look like a freak and an even bigger one if I have to explain myself about the epilepsy
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,Side notemy boss and I work in separate locations
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,everything we do is done via email
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,Im kind of like a virtual assistant except I work out of a large office with other assistants
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,reporting to people we dont share a building with
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I just cant imagine how awkward that phone call would be to explain to her that I hid my epilepsy for the last two months or why I did it
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,I also dont want anyone else in the office to hear that phone call
rfjj63,t5_2s1h9,If anyone has any advice I will gladly hear it

p0stos,t5_2r876,have you used them
p0stos,t5_2r876,I was wondering if any of you had experience using air purifiers at home
p0stos,t5_2r876,How was it
p0stos,t5_2r876,I live in Santiago de Chile and here the air is quite polluted
p0stos,t5_2r876,maybe the purifier would help diminish coughing at home

sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,STOOL test and IBS Hello
sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,I had a colonoscopy and it is all clear
sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,No sign of any IBDs
sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,And i just had a  CALPROTECTIN
sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,STOOL test with the result of mcgg
sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,Does that mean I have IBS
sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,Some website says it is normal
sw9mrf,t5_2s3g1,Some says it at the borderline
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,advice needed on omeprazole vs lansoprazole ive taken omeprazole for years mg per day split but its stopped being as effective has endoscopy all ok
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,so doctor switched me to lansoprazole mg per day split however i think its worsening my depression
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,unfortunately the lansoprazole is more effective though
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,however i found a conversion chart that stated mg of lansoprazole is equivalent to mg of omeprazole
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,so it makes sense that im getting better symptoms of gerd with the lansoprazole
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,and yet from past interactions with other doctors it seems like me taking mg of omeprazole per day is out of the question as its too high
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,but i feel like this would be a great solution for me cos it doesnt aggravate the depression
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,what do you guys think
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,btw h blockers also seem to aggravate the depression sadly
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,and i dont think its anything to do with antidepressant medication not being absorbed properly because i take my medicines too close together or anything because like ive said the omeprazole is no problem for depression
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,should i shoot for mg omeprazole per day at my next doctors appt
s0w5gu,t5_2qlaa,i hate having acid but i cant deal with this worsened depression

q8b848,t5_2r876,I am potentially moving to Daytona with a friend of mine
q8b848,t5_2r876,Navigating the FL medicaid site is actually horrible
q8b848,t5_2r876,I am in KY now and my clinic has been great

q8b848,t5_2r876,I am disabled through SSA SSI
q8b848,t5_2r876,so I should automatically qualify
q8b848,t5_2r876,I am just concerned about the difference in medicaid
q8b848,t5_2r876,how easy it would be to transfer to their medicaid program
q8b848,t5_2r876,and potential CF clinics
q8b848,t5_2r876,I think my  closest options would be Orlando and Jacksonville
q8b848,t5_2r876,Anyone have any experience with those clinics
q8b848,t5_2r876,Also any experience with FL medicaid or getting medicaid in FL after moving

sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,Dr says Ive got IBS but Im not entirely sure
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,Ive been having these stomach cramps and they flare up with stress but I also get them when Im not stressed
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,They kinda feel like anxiety in my stomach
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,Not bloating or butterflies
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,but rather like tension
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,Like a gut feeling that something is wrong   So for example if Im driving and theres a car in front of me and they slam on breaks
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,I freak out and feel that stress in my stomach first and then itll stay for a couple hours or maybe days
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,I know I am gluten and dairy sensitive as well but I dont feel like its a major issue  My Dr has given me Lybrax for the stomach cramps and its helped but I just dont feel like I have IBS because my other symptoms arent that bad
sx5njz,t5_2s3g1,Does anyone else get that anxiety feeling in their stomach

snaw2b,t5_2tyg2,Non-psychotic delusions and hallucinations makes no sense I dont understand what Non-psychotic delusion mean
snaw2b,t5_2tyg2,because Delusional Disorder is a form of psychotic disorder
snaw2b,t5_2tyg2,I am concerned that this article is misleading and downplaying the delusions that people with ASD more likely to experience
snaw2b,t5_2tyg2,pdf   The study is from Japan
snaw2b,t5_2tyg2,they use different language
snaw2b,t5_2tyg2,but this non-psychotic hallucinations or delusions are more common than hallucinations or delusions that arise from actual psychotic disorders is very misleading
snaw2b,t5_2tyg2,because delusions and hallucinations are symptom of psychosis
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,Problems with Globus for  months
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,I need help Ive had horrible
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,intense globus sensation for almost a year now
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,The lump I feel is slightly below the place where I make vocalizations
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,For example
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,if make the K noise like in Cow
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,the lump is definitely below that point
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,It feels like someone is choking me in that area
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,I went to an ENT
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,he performed a laryngoscopy
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,and said that everything looked normal
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,He said the area he examined was a little bit red so it could be mild LPR
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,He told me to take a PPI for  months
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,and to my disappointment
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,it had no effect on the globus at all
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,A friend suggested sodium alginate for LPR to me mg after each meal and before bed
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,so Im going to try that next for  month
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,but so far in using it for  days it has had no effect
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,I talked to my ENT again after the PPI not working
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,and he said to try allergy medication loratidine claritin mgday for a month
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,and if that doesnt work he said I should consider anti-depressants for anxiety
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,even though Ive had no symptoms of anxiety or depression
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,Should I go to a GI
rti7yn,t5_2qlaa,What should I do next
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,PPIs Messed Me Up
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,Terrified Of Long Term Implications Hey guys
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,Im  years old
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,I recently went to the GI
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,Had stomach polyps due to the PPI and a fungal infection due to gluten intolerance which was the reason for my chronic reflux I found out
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,I also was critically low on B which the Dr said was also due to the PPI
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,Ive been taking PPIs once a day for around  years OTC like an idiot and stopped now after the Dr said I need to stop gluten and thats helped my reflux almost go away just in a couple weeks
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,I came across studies and endless articles yesterday about PPIs causing kidney disease
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,And I havent been able to sleep
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,Especially since I already got several side effects from PPIs
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,I understand theres a lot of controversy around these studies and was hoping if someone can shed some light on the possibilities of my kidneys getting messed up or gastric cancer after daily use for  years
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,Edit I forgot to mention Im a lifelong vegetarian and that my B was always on the lower end
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,But the GI was the first doctor to tell me it was critically low
rf416d,t5_2qlaa,So perhaps the B wasnt so much due to the PPI

sld2u0,t5_2r876,Gj tube site feels hard  not granulation Ive had my gj tube for  days now
sld2u0,t5_2r876,The tube site started really hurting today
sld2u0,t5_2r876,for the first time during cleaning
sld2u0,t5_2r876,I discovered that around the tube site
sld2u0,t5_2r876,its super hard and swollen
sld2u0,t5_2r876,its not granulation tissue
sld2u0,t5_2r876,nothing is coming out of the wound Its not bleeding or pushing
sld2u0,t5_2r876,but my abdominal wall itself feels like a hard disc around it
sld2u0,t5_2r876,Like inside the tissue
sld2u0,t5_2r876,as if my abdomen has become rigid
sld2u0,t5_2r876,Havent noticed it before that
sld2u0,t5_2r876,Im scared that I have an infection
sld2u0,t5_2r876,but the site is cleaned every day and doesnt smell or ooze  yet
sld2u0,t5_2r876,Could this be the start
sld2u0,t5_2r876,Or is this normal
sld2u0,t5_2r876,and just part of healing process

spx94b,t5_2s23e,How do you cope
spx94b,t5_2s23e,had it for a year but diagnosed three months ago
spx94b,t5_2s23e,Lucky enough to have a relatively slow progression can still walk for long distances and even run
spx94b,t5_2s23e,but unlucky to have significant cognitive decline
spx94b,t5_2s23e,Just eight months ago I was with the love of my life
spx94b,t5_2s23e,was planning on going to law school
spx94b,t5_2s23e,and was in the best shape of my life physically
spx94b,t5_2s23e,Eight months later I have incontinence
spx94b,t5_2s23e,near dementia-like cognitive decline and cant even remember what I ate for breakfast
spx94b,t5_2s23e,Cant workout anymore
spx94b,t5_2s23e,but can still jog
spx94b,t5_2s23e,How do you find the strength to keep going
spx94b,t5_2s23e,The fact that itll only get worse horrifies me
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,In a bit of a pickle which medicine to go with
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,diagnosed today only confirmed what I already knew
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,So I have an appointment with my neuro coming up soon
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,to discuss medication
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,As i understand it
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,right off the bat I will have two choices Rituximab and Mavenclad
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,Im looking for experiences and recommendations here
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,Been trying to read up on both
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,and they both seem promising
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,even thought they are somewhat different
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,For the Rituximab I have to participate in a study
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,forms and whatnot and i hate needles
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,but if I have to
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,Ill still do it
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,The Mavenclad I can get prescribed the same day and start right away
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,A little bit about my progression Ive only had symptoms since the previous summer
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,with double vision for a couple of weeks and some numbnessweakness in my leg one weak
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,one numb which passed
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,Now I can hardly notice
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,except maybe a sort of depressivelethargic state which may or may not be linked to MS   On a side note
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,i like smoking weed from time to time
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,and its something I really enjoy
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,and a nice reward for myself
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,Will any of these be a showstopper
s1i6fs,t5_2s23e,     Thanks for all feedback
s0tj9d,t5_2s23e,Ocrevus users how long did you wait after your infusion to get a COVID booster
s0tj9d,t5_2s23e,I was told not to take the booster  month before or after an infusion
s0tj9d,t5_2s23e,but otherwise the timing was my decision
s0tj9d,t5_2s23e,Just wondering what other people have decided
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,Is there someone whose job it is to help people get support
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,Im asking on behalf of a friend who has lupus
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,It makes it very difficult for her to work consistently
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,and due to life events she has had severe stress which has caused other issues to pop up
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,So she literally cant work until shes had time and space to get healthier
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,and shes not getting it
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,I cant support her financially but I can probably pay for someone to do so specifically to assess if she is eligible for any form of aid and then help her navigate those waters as much as possible
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,Does anyone know if there is a job where people do that
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,Something where I could enter a title into a search engine
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,Ive heard social worker
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,but based on my searches they mostly do therapy
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,Any thoughts are appreciated
rn4kqy,t5_2rtve,thank you in advance
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,Something different is happening
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,Ive had IBS for  years
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,Its been under control for a few years now
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,Peppermint tea does the job if I get a bit of discomfort
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,About  weeks ago I started to literally double up with stomach pain
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,I wondered if I had done something different
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,The only thing is I had started eating porridge for breakfast
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,I read that some people are intolerant to a gluten type protein in it so I stopped
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,The massive pain has mainly faded but Im left with this raw feeling in my stomach
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,like my insides have been removed
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,I feel extremely bloated and full of gas
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,Im thinking maybe Gastritis
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,GP is sending me for a colonoscopy and endoscopy but its taking a while to get an appointment
swwjjc,t5_2s3g1,Some advice in the meantime would be helpful

ripncf,t5_2s1h9,Seizure After Booster Not saying the booster was related to my seizure but before I go on
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,a little back story
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I was on  mg of keppra a day for almost  years
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I had my first seizure in Nov
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I realized that I thought my  dosage may be too high because around June 
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I would be so tired after taking keppra
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,The doctor lowered my dosage to  mg a day then and there
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I was fine all the way until Nov  
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I honestly will admit that I did intermittingly forget to take my pills here and there take in morning and forget in evening viceversa and about  minutes after I fell asleep
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I had a seizure
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I had another seizure about  minutes after I fell asleep and this time I was on my medication without issue
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,The only thing different was that I had my flu and covid booster  hours earlier
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,Do you think there is a link
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,My doctor said there could be but is not sure
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I want to go back to  mg a day but he only upped my meds by  so now I am on  mg a day
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I am so afraid of having another seizure
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I have never had a seizure during the day only at night
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,As of now
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,my Dr has not called me back again wanting to go back to  mg a day
ripncf,t5_2s1h9,I am seeking a second opinion
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,Why does chewing my food slowly get rid of gerd but I still have burping and a slight feeling of indigestion
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,Someone told me that digestion starts in the mouth and I needed to chew my food until it turned into a liquid until swallowing it
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,I was a bit hesitant because I like eating food really fast
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,So I tried it and
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,I literally have no heartburn or acid reflux
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,I still have bloating and burping that comes up every now and then
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,and very rarley theres a slight vomit feeling coming up but then it somehow gets blocked and I cant vomit
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,its like a reflux fail basically
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,Im annoyed I have to eat food so slow because I get less enjoyment from it
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,but if it works it works
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,Now I tell myself this line all the time If you aint gonna chew
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,dont eat the food and I keep that playing in my head so I dont ever eat quickly again
rntijr,t5_2qlaa,because as soon as I do I get all my symptoms again
